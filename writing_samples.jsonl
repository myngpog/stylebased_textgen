{"text": "Wait where the glaze lilies bloom:\n\nSummary:\n\nA collection of snippets depicting the friendship between the God of Geo and the God of Dust.\n\n🌼 1. I first saw you in a field of flowers.\n\n\"Wisdom is like water, it nourishes all those who receive it and in it is a reflection of the truth.\"'\n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nI first saw you in a field of flowers.\n\nThe ringing in my ears that day wouldn’t stop. If I had known it was a premonition, then I wouldn’t have approached you the way I did— or maybe it would have been better if I hadn’t altogether.\n \nThe sky that day was a beautiful hue of orange, but if one squints hard enough, then I dare say the color resembled your hair. \n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nThe cool afternoon breeze danced around the lone feminine figure as she walked along the edges of Dihua Marsh. The breeze played with her flowing robes and hair, whimsically picking it up and down, to and fro— as if it had a mind of its own. \n\nHumming to herself in content, she bent down to pluck a glaze lily, her most favorite flower. As her hands gracefully bring the flower up, her head bends slightly down, intending to meet the flower halfway. \n\nBut the blue flower’s fragrance never got to reach her nose.\n\n“Haaa.” A sigh.\n\nHer head jolted to the source of the sound, the motion ruining her once elegant demeanor. \n\nIn place of the sound stood a tall, young(?) man. His long, black, flowing hair, rivaling hers in length, was kept in a low ponytail. His black robes were as elegant and frivolous as hers, indicating that he was not a mere villager.\n\nAs if on cue with their eye contact, the breeze started to pick up, causing the lone petals on the ground to scatter up and about. As the two internally battled to keep eye contact, the blue petals slowly descended back to the ground, losing their battle to gravity. \n\nIt was a picturesque-perfect scene— maybe the breeze did have a mind of its own. \n\n“D-Did you just sigh at me?” the female asked, looking perplexed at the man standing a few feet from her.\n\n“Hmm, I’m not so sure myself. Did I?” the man responded, lowering his gaze to the flower in her hand.\n\nHis shift in attention hadn’t gone unnoticed.\n\n“Ah, are you perhaps inquiring about this?” she motioned to the flower, slowly twirling it counterclockwise.\n\nHe gave a small nod in response.\n\n“It’s a glaze lily. I’m very fond of them,” she continued, this time giving it a small whiff to make up for the missed opportunity from before. “They’re beautiful, don’t you think?”\n\nShe looked up. \n\nNo response.\n\nHe stared intently at her, “if you are as fond of it as you say you are, then why did you cut its life short?”\n\nHer eyes widened in shock, visibly taken aback by his rather direct question.\n\nDelicate fingers found its way to her chin as she pondered, looking for a satisfactory enough answer. \n\n“Well…,” she started looking down, long lashes clouding her eyes.\n\n“If you truly hold someone close to your heart, then wouldn’t you want them with you?” she looked up, meeting his gaze, lashes raised to unveil the many layers of depth.\n\nBrown meets amber in an abyss of loud silence.\n\n“Eh— of course I’m not saying you should kill off people you hold dear but—,” confidence parted with her as quickly as it had come.\n\n“You see, it’s different when it’s a flower. Plucking it from its roots doesn’t mean inevitable death. If I care for it well then it’ll continue to blossom.”\n\n“Nonetheless, regardless of whether one harbors human emotions or not, it is ultimately best to let it be,” the man shot back.\n\n“Pardon? Human emotions?” \n\n“Yes, human emotions. It is because of said emotions that humans are rendered as weak as they are. They are nothing but a handicap and is the reason why humans depend on us gods.”\n\n“Us? Gods?” she questioned flabbergasted.\n\nThe man held his sternness, unfazed by his counterpart choking on her words.\n\n“Ah… So you know,” Guizhong sighed as she parted her bangs from her forehead,\n\n“I’m Guizhong. God of Dust,” she extended her hand, shortening the distance between them. \n\n“Morax. Morax, God of Geo.”\n\nGuizhong’s extended arm was left unattended as Morax turned away from her and started his trek away. \n\n\nShe looked up at him perplexed and stared daggers into his retreating back. But despite the look she gave him, she decided it would be a good idea to finish the rest of her stroll besides him. After all, it wasn’t everyday you find a fellow god on human lands, much less when and where the glaze lilies were blooming. \n\nThis was definitely a sign. \n\nShe grabbed parts of her robes and pulled them up lightly, ensuring she wasn’t harming them anywhere, and jogged up to him. \n\nUpon her appearance at his side, he eyed her, raising his left eyebrow, giving her a most suspicious look. A look Guizhong ignored. \n\n“So…” she started, trying to ease the tension. “What are you doing on mortal lands?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Awe, come on, there must be a reason as to why you’re down here,” she whined at his lame answer. “I’ve been down here many, many, times and not once have I encountered another deity.”\n\n“Hmph,” he glanced at her, keeping his head forward. “Even if I did have a reason, I do not have a reason to share it with you.”\n\n“Fine, alright.” she lowered her head defeatedly. “Sorry I cared and asked.”\n\nMorax’s attention is now fully on the road they were walking whilst Guizhong’s was at the ground beneath her and the flower in her hand.\n\nThe awkwardness was killing her. She didn’t know how to keep a conversation with someone as boring and dull as Morax.\n\nWhy did she even decide to join him in the first place? She racked her brain over and over at the rash decision to run up to and walk alongside him. \n\n“It would be best if you stopped wearing your heart on your sleeve.”\n\nAs luck would have it, she did not need to break the silence.\n\n“And what’s the matter with that?” she inquired looking up from the ground, fixing her posture at the same time.\n\n“Everything. Maybe coming down here so often negatively impacted you,” Morax continued. “Alas, there must be a reason as to why you don’t see anyone else.”\n\n“You do know that ‘everything’ doesn’t answer anything, right?” she remarked, slowly losing her patience.\n\nHaa. Another sigh elicited from the tall man. \n\n“Harboring human emotions will do you no benefit. Nor coming all the way here, unless there is a good enough reason,” he explained.\n\nShe eyed him victoriously. “So you do have a reason.”\n\nMorax guffawed at her ignoring his main point altogether. “That was not my point.”\n\n“Yeah yeah,” she smiled, turning back to the road, happy to have dodged his judgemental comment with her sly one. \n\nThey once again fell into silence. However, Guizhong thought it wasn’t so awkward this time. After all, it is only awkward if she makes it awkward.\n\nNonetheless, she decided to speak up again, “So Morax, tell me about yourself.”\n\nTo her sudden inquiry, he turned to her hesitantly. Upon looking at her face, he was greeted with a solemn, yet sincere, smile. One that showed her eagerness to hearing his story, no traces of a possible rejection in it. \n\nDrawn to the serenity, he couldn’t help but open his mouth. \n\n~~~~~\n\nShe had listen to him intently, making sure to not miss a single word from the Geo Archon.\n\nAs his story was coming to a close, so did their stroll together.\n\n“Say, since I have done all the talking, it is your turn.”\n\nGuizhong chuckled. “Must I have to? Our journey together is nearing its end,” she said as she looked down the road before them.\nMorax followed the direction of her gaze.\n\n“Not quite yet. There is still a good amount of steps left.”\n\nShe hummed in agreement, “well what would you like to inquire about?”\n\nHe looked at her, then at the flower still snuggled in her hand.\n\n“The glaze lily, why are you so fond of them? They are most obviously the reason as to why you are down here, on this day and time.”\n\nAs the steps required to finish the path they were on lowered, Guizhong thought deep and hard at Morax’s question. \n\n“There is no particular reason as to why I am this fond of them,” she smiled looking down at the flower and giving it a subtle twirl.\n\n“But if I were to give a reason, then it would be because it reminds me of humans,” she looked up to meet his gaze.\n\nAt where they are, they can see the city coming into view, their journey together coming ever so closer to an end. \n\nHis gaze darkened at her naivety, most fondness he had found for her beginning to fade. \n\n“You must think I’m stupid for sympathizing with them,” she started.\n\n\"But those humans are as small and fragile as dust,” she continued. \"And because they are so small, they know not when they will lose their lives to disaster or strife, and so they are afraid.\"\n\n\"And because they are afraid, they try harder to become more intelligent. In a sense, they are like glaze lilies, fighting for survival amongst a cruel world,\" she said as her gaze shifted from flower to the city before them. \n\nThen she turned back to him. “You had asked me why I come down here as often as I do. It is because I want to help those humans. The same ones you presume are weak.”\n\n\"And I thought that since there is such a gulf between us in strength, I should use technique and wisdom instead. With your brawn and my brains, I’m sure this city would surely become a great one,“ she finished in a hush and faced him with her most lovely, yet lonely, smile. \n\nMorax’s expression darkened. \n\n“Guizhong. You know I can not.”\nShe looked down and nodded solemnly.\n\n“It was at least worth a shot,” she hummed. “For I can not achieve this alone.”\n\nHe sympathetically looked at her, then to the flower in her hand, then to the village just across the shore from them.\n\nHe sighed in defeat.\n\n“I…” he started. “I can assist you.”\n\nHer head jolted, revealing her surprised expression at his sudden change in decision.\n \n“O-Only if you prove to me they are worthy of the Geo Archon’s help.”\n\nGuizhong was beaming at his earlier statement, his new one doing little to change her giddiness.\n\n“Yes, I shall prove to you what they are capable of,” she said excitedly as she took his hands in hers, squishing the flower between their palms.\n\nMorax nodded, expressing his ‘you’re welcome.’\n\n“It’s a contract then,” she beamed remembering his fondness of contracts when he told her about himself.\n\nMorax flashed a light grin, “Indeed. Indeed it is.”\n\n“Oh, here!” her eyes turned wide as she fumbled in her pockets and pulled out a stone dumbbell. “Take this!”\n\nShe ushered Morax to open his hand so she could hand him said ‘stone dumbbell’.\n\n“This is the mark of our pledge, and it is also my challenge to you.”\n\nMorax looked at her in a most confused look, “Challenge?”\n\n“All my wisdom is hidden within this stone dumbbell,” she answered. “In exchange for helping me, you will acquire my wisdom.” \n\n“That is… only if you are able to unlock it,” she smiled cheekily, glancing from him to the dumbbell, now in his hands. \n\n“How is this a fair deal?” he asked her amused, raising his left eyebrow.\n “If your brain holds intellect, you should be able to open it. And if you do, then I would be at the lower end of the deal. It’s more than fair, no?”\n\nMorax did not have anything to say, so Guizhong took his silence as agreement to their contract.\n\n“Well, this journey has come to an end,” Guizhong said as she looked over the marsh, night falling over them.\n\nMhm. Morax hummed in agreement.\n\n“But it won’t be our last one together,” she smiled as she looked back at him.\n\nMhm. Morax hummed again in agreement.\n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nOn that day and at that place, when and where the glaze lilies were in abundant bloom, was also the day my life was permanently altered. \n\nI think glaze lilies have also become something I am very fond of. \n\nA lot of what you like has grown on me, not because of the reasons you like them for though, but because they all remind me of you. \n\nEvery time that fateful season comes around, when they are at their peak, I can’t help but find my way back to Dihua Marsh. \n\nMost of me wants to move on and leave you behind, but a part of me wants to be taken back to that time and place.\n\nBack to when I saw you in a field of flowers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌼 2. The Memory of You\n\"Virtue grows tall like a tree, though there be shade it will flourish forever.\"\n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nThe second time I saw you was not as memorable as the first, but little did I know that that day would be one of the few I cherish. \n\nEven after all these years, the memories have not left me, and I doubt it ever will. \n\nEvery so often, I can’t help but reminisce back to then.\n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nMorax squinted as remnants of the sun fought through the cracks and openings of the very same item Guizhong had entrusted him with. \n\nIn the few days following his meeting with the God of Dust, he spent his waking hours trying to figure out the stone dumbbell and retrieve ‘Guizhong’s wisdom’ as she had promised.\n\nBeing on the losing end of a contract did not sit well with the God of Contracts himself. \n\nAs one hand lifted up the item in question to the light, his other hand sat on the round stone tabletop, fingers tapping away in a synchronized rhythm. \n\nHow pointless. Morax thought to himself as his fingers rotated the stone dumbbell, also dubbed ‘puzzle’ by Guizhong herself. \n\nHe did not go through the trouble of counting but it must’ve been on the 100th rotation when he heard an all too familiar voice behind him. \n\n“Mor— uh Zhongli!” a feminine voice called out to the waiting adepti.\n\nMorax had given Guizhong the name ‘Zhongli’, to be used when they were on mortal lands. While doing so, he attempted to settle on one for Guizhong herself. But to his suggestion, she told him that it was already too late for her to be using an alias. A fact he deadpanned at. \n\n“Zhongli!” Guizhong called again as the distance between them closed. “My apologies, did you wait for long?”\n\nTo her inquiry, the sitting adepti looked up at her. He showed her the puzzle, nestled between his thumb and his index fingers, giving it a little shake. \n\n“No, it wasn’t that long a wait,” he started. “But any second tardier, and I would have decided to smash this dumbbell into the stone table.”\n\nGuizhong rolled her eyes at her partner’s remark.\n\n“Surely that would ‘solve’ it,” she decided to play along with him, her fingers forming makeshift quotation marks to put emphasis on ‘solve’. \n\nZhongli nodded slightly from where he sat. “I am the brawns after all.”\n\nHis reference to their conversation a few days back stifled a light chuckle from Guizhong.\n\n“Alright alright, you win,” she said as she sat down on the stone stool just on the other side of him.\n\nShe shuffled around a bit on the stool before settling into a comfy enough position, both hands on the table in an upright stance to support her chin, and ultimately, her upper body, slightly leaning over the table. \n\nZhongli noted her posture could be better but decided against verbalizing his inner monologue. \n\n“So how are you faring out with the puzzle?” Guizhong asked, eyeing her possession in his hands.\n\nHe shrugged. “I’m convinced you had done something to rig it.”\n\nHis suspicion uttered a loud laugh from Guizhong. Her back contorted backwards, further terrorizing her already questionable posture, as her hands reached for her stomach, any elegance she had left trailing away from her. \n\n“No, no I do not think I did,” she started as her chimes died down. \n\nZhongli looked down at the puzzle still perched in his hand, patiently waiting to be solved.\n\n“Well, progress could be better.”\n\nGuizhong left his response unattended as she, too, looked down at the stone dumbbell in his hands, boredly eyeing it. \n\n“Enough with trying to figure it out,” she whined as she stood up from her stool, long hair draping over her shoulders. “How about we get this day started and do what we had come to accomplish?”\n\nThe feminine figure extended her hands towards Zhongli, who was still sitting, dumbbell in his hands.\n\nHe looked up at her and smiled, tucking the dumbbell away back into the confines of his dark robes, in contrast from Guizhong’s light ones.\n\nDespite his shift in attitude compared to their first encounter, he left her hand hanging, as with the first time. But he nevertheless took the spot beside her as they walked away from the set of table and stools on the side of the road.\n\n~~~\n\n“How are you planning to accomplish your goal today?” Zhongli inquired as the sun’s rays got all the more impenetrable, the effects of summer getting more and more obvious to him on mortal lands.\n\nGuizhong beamed at his question. Her hands found their way to pockets hidden inside the many layers of her robe, fumbling around for something.\n\n“Ah!” she made a sound of affirmation, moving her hands around, seemingly to confirm the item she found was indeed the right one.\n\n“Here!” she said as she whipped the item out, her speed making Zhongli jump in surprise.\n\nShe held the parchment scroll horizontally, letting gravity do its job as the content unfolded itself. The extended scroll’s length reached past her waist from her chin.\n\nBoth adeptis halted in their tracks, Guizhong excitedly showing off her pride, Zhongli looking at her quizzically, convinced she’s not as intelligent as they both thought she was.\n\n“This is a list of what we are gonna do today!”\n\n“You want us to… to do all of that?” Zhongli asked as he grimaced at the numerous lines stacked on top of each other. It seemed Guizhong had utilized the parchment’s full length.\n\n“Well I had a hard time fishing out the human’s best qualities, so I wrote out all of them,” Guizhong started as she angled the front of the parchment towards her so she could look over its contents.\n\n“Although it does look like a whole lot...” she sighed as she stared at the parchment from top to bottom. \n\nHer delicate fingers found its way to her chin, a gesture she often does when she is in deep thought, Zhongli noted.\n\n“I guess I’ll just have to choose the best options from this extensive list,” she reasoned.\n\n“That is indeed quite the extensive list,” he looked at her then to the sun, now directly above them, signalling high noon.\n\n“The day is halfway over,” his gaze found his way back to her. “Are you sure you can convince me?”\n\nIn response to his challenge, she grinned and rolled the scroll back up.\n\n“Even if I did not have this,” with the scroll now rolled back up to its original shape and in her hand, she elegantly tapped his nose with it, “I think I will fare just fine.”\n\nNow back on the dirt road, Guizhong started walking ahead, slightly faster than before to make up for their wasted time.\n\nShe turned back to the male figure, “Unlike you with the stone dumbbell.”\n\nAt the remark, Zhongli chuckled and walked to catch up to her, not finding the need to jog as his human legs were a whole few inches taller than hers.\n\n~~~\n\nLaughter and chatter danced their way around the adepti pair as they entered the human city.\n\nTo Zhongli’s left, were local street vendors selling their specialties, bellowing over their stands hoping to attract attention and share their gift to the rest of the world. To his right were like minded shoppers, walking up and down the marketplace, inspecting the goods, wisely choosing what to spend their money on— as they did not have much to begin with.\n\n“Welcome to the city!” Guizhong chirped, as she walked in front of Zhongli, with her back facing the front. “This is where we’ll be spending the rest of our day.”\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that her walking backwards made him nervous. \n\n“Does this city not have a name?” Zhongli inquired, noting what Guizhong had called the city.\n\n“Mmm, no,” she started. “Not yet at least. It seems the residents have yet to come up with one.” \n\nBy now, she had resumed the normal way of walking, melting into her place besides Zhongli once again. \n\n“You see, it has just been recently established.”\n\nNot seeing the need to verbally respond, he nodded softly, signalling his understanding to Guizhong. \n\nHis passiveness,however, did not faze his female companion as she smirked at him, “who knows, maybe you can name it.”\n\n“I highly doubt the chances of that.”\n\nIgnoring Zhongli’s pessimism, she shrugged. “You can never be too sure.”\n\nJust as she had finished her sentence, a voice chimed in from the duo’s left.\n\n“Guizhong!” a booming voice beckoned. “Just how long has it been?” \n\nBoth adeptis halted in their tracks, heads turning to their left to the source of the new voice.\n\nThe man who called for Guizhong seemed to be in his late 20s. His hair was a light fluffy brown, bangs messy but the rest of its length was tied into a bun, the green ribbon flowing down behind him. He wore a simple green colored garment, which further accentuated his fondness for the color.\n\nZhongli eyed Guizhong questioningly. Guizhong, oblivious to Zhongli’s silent inquiry, half-skipped her way to the stand and to the man awaiting her just on the other side of it.\n\n“Ah! Guan Suo!” Guizhong beamed at the man in question. “Has it been that long? I remember it only being a week or two.” \n\nZhongli hesitantly followed Guizhong, halting in his tracks just beside her. The stand was small in width, but long in length. Zhongli noticed that it was home to many different types of pottery, its many many hues of colors, shapes, and sizes clashing with each other. However, when all put together, the visual presentation was nonetheless stunning. He wouldn’t be surprised if the stand alone attracted a good amount of curious onlookers. It was the only color in the otherwise dull, wooden building behind the seller. \n\n“Well, it felt wayyy longer than that for me,” Guan Suo responded, seemingly ecstatic at Guizhong’s unexpected drop-by, completely ignoring Zhongli. \n\nAhem. \n\nBoth heads turned to Zhongli, the source of the sound.\n\nGuizhong sent him a quick glare, seemingly upset at his rude way of interrupting her ‘catching up’ session.\n\n“This is my good friend Zhongli,” she nevertheless introduced him to the man over the stand. “Zhongli, this is my other good friend, Guan Suo.” \n\n“Ah! How nice to meet you!” Guan Suo started, extending a hand towards Zhongli. \n\nZhongli stared at it until he felt a nudge at his side. It was Guizhong ushering him to not leave the poor man hanging.\n\n“Likewise,” he took it and gave Guan Suo a firm, solid shake, although begrudgingly. \n\nTo this, Guan Suo shrugged and continued his earlier conversation with Guizhong. \n\n“How long will you be here for? Are you free later? We could grab something to eat and catch up.” \n\nGuizhong looked at him apprehensively, “Ah, apologies Guan Suo. I have something to attend to for the rest of the day today.”\n\n“Oh, that’s fine too!” he responded happily, although the disappointment was clear.\n\n“Maybe next time?” \n\n“Yeah, for sure! Just tell me when you’re here and I’ll close up shop early just for you m’lady.”\n\nZhongli noticed Guizhong’s cheeks were now a slightly pinker shade than before.\n\nGuizhong nodded happily at Guan Suo’s suggestion.\n\nZhongli scoffed at the interaction. “Are you done now Guizhong? We must get going if you wish to finish the rest of your list.”\n\nShe looked up at him, nodding in agreement. “Ah you’re right, we shall go.”\n\n“I’ll see you next time Guan Suo,” she waved at the man before turning to catch up to Zhongli who had already started the trek away. \n\n“Likewise,” the man over the stand waved, as he looked at the two retreating backs.\n\n~~~ \n\n“Zhongli wait up!” Guizhong called as she struggled to catch up to him. “Must you be in such a hurry?”\n\n“I am just attempting to finish your list in time,” he responded, slowing down a bit for her.\n\n“Well, one item on my list was to introduce you to all my friends here,” she said between breaths as she finally caught up to him.\n\nZhongli’s eyes narrowed. “You best think of a new one to replace that item or omit it altogether if that is the case.”\n\n“Hm? How come?” she looked up at him from her spot besides him as they continued to walk through the marketplace.\n\n“Alternatively, you can keep it and fail to convince me,” he suggested. “So far, your list is failing to do so.”\n\nGuizhong sighed. “Alright. I understand that you have trouble interacting with mere humans. Thanks Grandpa, I’ll keep that in mind. ”\n\nZhongli ignored her.\n\n“Anyways, the location for one of my other items is just ahead of us!” Guizhong pointed to a stand a few feet away from them.\n\n“I hope you’re hungry cause it’s time for lunch,” grabbing Zhongli’s arm, she dragged him to the place in question. \n\n“Our kind do not starve,” Zhongli told her as he was being dragged after her. \n\n“Whatever, grandpa,” she rolled her eyes. “At least we’re not impartial to taste.” \n\n“Guizhong! Pleasure seeing you here!” a high, elated voice sounded from behind the stand.\n\nThe greeting belonged to a young female. Under the sun, her hair shined a light brown, almost sandy. Her light bangs, with two longer strands on either side of her face, framed her small face, giving her an even more youthful look. The rest of her hair was held in a low braided bun, crowned with a green embroidered headpiece, with the rest of her attire being a light, almost pastel, blue. \n\n“Bao!” Guizhong chimed, lifting her right hand to wave at the girl behind the stand.\n\nHer left hand pulled at Zhongli’s sleeves, bringing him  closer to her, until they were only a few inches apart.\n\n“This is Zhongli, a good friend of mine.”\n\nBao directed her gaze to her friend’s left and eyed the man in question up and down.\n\n“O-Oh my Guizhong,” Bao’s gaze stopped at the male adepti’s face. “You didn’t tell me you were friends with someone as attractive as him.”\n\nGuizhong snorted at her friend’s remark, knowing that adeptis can choose any form they wish to inhabit. \n\n“Well I had just met him,” Guizhong shrugged.\n\n“Ah!” Bao’s eyes widened as she remembered something. “I’m Bao by the way. Bao Sanniang.”\n\nThe girl waved to Zhongli from behind the food stand.\n\n“Pleasure to meet you,” Zhongli responded, giving her a small smile, resulting in the female’s now reddened cheeks.\n\n“S-So Guizhong, would you like the usual?” deciding the man’s attention was too much for her, Bao turned hers back to her friend. \n\n“Yes please, but add just one more,” Guizhong said, eyeing Zhongli. \n\n“Got it,” Bao responded happily as she bent down to grab something from the stall’s confines, starting Guizhong’s orders.\n\n“So,” Guizhong turned to her partner for the day. “Do you have some mora prepared?”\n\n“Pardon?” Zhongli turned his attention down to her as the two waited for Bao in front of the stand.\n\n“Mora.” \n\n“What?”\n\n“Mora. It’s only the currency the whole of Teyvat uses.”\n\n“I know what it is,” Zhongli deadpanned. “It was named after me,” he whispered the latter, rather aggressively. \n\nGuizhong’s eyes slightly widened at the newfound knowledge, lips parting to form a silent ‘o’ upon drawing the connection.\n\n“Then what on Teyvat are you asking for?”\n\n“Well, I don’t have any on me,” he passively responded. \n\n“Ah...,” Guizhong was quick to catch on. “It’s still quite a shame,” she giggled at the irony. \n\n“I’ve never had the need for such trivial things,” he said, indirectly hinting at the other part of Liyue, the one which mortals are not as familiar with.\n\n“Well, it’s alright,” Guizhong smiled at him, reaching inside her robe. “It is my honor to pay for you.” \n\nA few seconds later, she pulled out a pouch, lightly jiggling it in front of Zhongli, as if to silently show him its contents with the sound the bag made. \n\n“After all, it’s not every day one can say they paid for the person mora was named after,” she finished in a hushed whisper, making sure it was only heard between the both of them before giving him a quick wink.\n\nTo this, Zhongli could not help but chuckle, amused at Guizhong’s way of thinking. Unknowingly to her, his fondness for her was bigger than it was the day they first met.\n\n~~~\n\n“Anddd… done!” Bao ringed in, appearing right behind the stand once again. “I really hope you two didn’t wait long.”\n\nGuizhong looked at her friend appreciatively. “Don’t worry Bao, it wasn’t that long a wait. I should be the one apologizing for such a big order.” \n\nBao smiled at Guizhong’s concern. “I’ve told you many many times before Guizhong! It’s really alright, if anything I’m glad I can help you in any way I can.”\n\nSeemingly to ignore the chef’s reassurance altogether, Guizhong flashed a sympathetic smile and paid for the food. In exchange for the mora, Bao handed her a big basket and two skewers.\n\nZhongli motioned to help Guizhong with the basket, only to be shooed away by her hand smacking his. \n\nHe gave her a questioning look.\n\n“You’re only to hold this,” she said as she handed him a skewer. “They’re chicken-mushroom skewers. My favorite.\n\n“Yes, but I should still help you with that basket,” he reasoned as he took the single skewer from her extended hand.\n\n“It’s fine, I got it.” she said as she tucked her mora pouch back into the pockets of her robes.\n\nGuizhong then proceeded to take the other skewer from Bao. She then worked to wrap her right hand securely over the basket, the right side of her body helping her to keep it safe from gravity’s harm.\n\n“Thanks again Bao,” she turned to thank the bubbly girl once again before she would start her walk away.\n\n“You’re very welcome Guizhong! Make sure to come back soon, it’ll be my treat next time!” the chef smiled and waved at the pair separated from her by the stand.\n\n“You too Zhongli, make sure to come again!” she happily called to him.\n\nZhongli nodded in her direction, giving her his gentle smile, to which she blushed at once again. \n\n~~~\n\nNow back on the main road, Zhongli and Guizhong joined the bustling crowd of people, melting in the midst of the laughter and chatter around them.\n\n“So these are chicken-mushroom skewers?” Zhongli asked as his hand motioned to bring the stick of delights up to his nose intending to smell the fragrance.\n\nGuizhong looked up at him from his side and beamed at him.\n\n“Yes!” she responded giddily. “They’re really good.”\n\n“They do smell quite nice,” Zhongle mumbled in agreement. \n\n“Then? What are you waiting for? Hurry, try them!” Guizhong half-shouted at him, eyes darting from him to the skewer in his hand, silently urging him to bring it to his mouth.\n\nTo her sudden demand, Zhongli lifted the skewer up to his chin and into his mouth, a motion Guizhong mirrored.\n\n“Haa. Bao makes the best skewers in all of Liyue,” Guizhong sighed delightedly, embellishing the warm first bite. “I can never get tired of them.”\n\nAs Zhongli swallowed his first bite, a smile found its way to his face.\n\n“It is quite…,” Zhongli started his statement, looking for the right word to finish it. “Nice.”\n\n“Right? It’s Bao’s creation!” Guizhong said as she motioned for another bite. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, someday, it’s famous around all of Liyue!” \n\nMhm. Zhongli hummed in agreement as he, too, enjoyed his second bite.\n\n“By the way, what’s in the basket?” Zhongli asked as he continued to enjoy his skewer.\n\n“Oh—,” Zhongli started but decided to swallow her food before continuing her sentence. “It’s more skewers.”\n\nZhongli eyed her quizzically. “I doubt we are able to finish that, no matter how delicious it is.” \n\n“Pfft,” Guizhong tried to hold in a laugh. “It’s not for us.” \n\n“Then who is it for?”\n\n“It’s for the next group of people I intend to introduce you to.” \n\nZhongli’s gaze turned from a puzzled one to a curious one at her response.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it,” he finally said as his mouth fought to resist a smile for the dozenth time that day. “Lead the way.”\n\n~~~\n\nAs they walked, the two adeptis eventually finished their skewers, held small talk as they walked, and attracted a lot of curious gazes. \n\nBut as often as they conversed, Zhongli never once asked Guizhong about their next location and its details. He grew to wholeheartedly trust her and had faith in her as an adepti, and also as a friend.\n\nGuizhong led the two of them to the very edge of the city. As they strayed further from its heart, the bubbling laughter and chatter slowly dwindled out, the bustling crowd and busybodies were no more.\n\nAnd at the very edge of the city, Zhongli saw a wooden house, fairly isolated from the rest of its counterparts that made the city what it was. A worn down wooden fence bordered the house’s circumference, giving it a fairly large amount of space to claim as its down.\n\nZhongli’s growing suspicion of their next hotspot for the day was confirmed as Guizhong continued her trek towards the house.\n\n“We’re here!” she beamed as they were a few feet away from the gate’s entrance. “The orphanage!”\n\nAs if on cue with Guizhong’s introduction of the place, children ran out of the house’s doors and towards the female adepti.\n\n“Sister Guizhong!” \n\n“Lady Guizhong!”\n\n“Miss Guizhong!”\n\nAlthough Zhongli only heard a few of the many titles the children referred Guizhong as, he picked up nothing but excitement, happiness, and respect from their tone.\n\n“Guizhong!” A gentle voice sounded from the back of the excited group.\n\nIt belonged to an older woman. Age and experience planted itself into her face, in all the wrinkles, scars, and tears. Her hair, more or less gray, was wrapped in a tight, neat bun at the back of her head giving her a regal, tidy look. \n\n“You’re here!” the lady, now at the front of the pack, greeted fondly. “What an unexpected surprise.”\n\n“Yes!” Guizhong answered, matching the lady’s fondness. “I’m here to pass these to the kid.” \n\nSimultaneously, Guizhong lifted the basket of chicken-mushroom skewer delights up, proudly showing off to the group surrounding her.\n\n“I’m also here as I have someone to introduce to you all!” she added happily, ushering Zhongli to walk up from his timid place behind her.\n\nTo her statement, all eyes turned to the nervous adepti. The staring eyes made him uncomfortable as he stepped up and found his place besides Guizhong.\n\n“Everyone, this is my new good friend, Zhongli!” \n\nOut of habit from god knows where, Zhongli timidly dipped his head, awkwardly bowing as the group continued to stare at him.\n\n“Nice to meet you Mr. Zhongli,” a shy voice from below peeped up.\n\nZhongli resumed his standing position, gaze turned towards the source of the voice.\n\n“I’m Remi,” a girl, around the young age of 7, smiled at Zhongli, flashing him her toothless grin.\n \nTo her awkward introduction, the other kids rushed to do the same, surrounding themselves around the tall, unexpecting man. \n\nWhile the children’s attention was focused on Zhongli, Guizhong walked up to the older lady, their sole caretaker.\n\n“Madame Peng, I’m sorry for coming unannounced,” she apologized as she went to place the basket on the table not far from them. \n\n“Don’t be, child. The children are always excited to have you here,” the older lady responded to her. “As am I.”\n\nGuizhong smiled at the lady.\n\n“He’s a good person,” Madame Peng continued as she eyed Zhongli, who was trying his best to interact with the plethora of kids surrounding him.\n\nGuizhong nodded and smiled as her gaze fell on the scene before the two. “He really is.”\n\nMadame Peng shifted her attention to the female adepti. “You two make a good pair.” \n\n“H-He’s just a friend,” Guizhong flailed her hands as she tried to deny the older woman’s smug remark. \n\nNot finding the need to say anything to further provoke the poor girl, Madame Peng smiled satisfactorily at Guizhong’s denial, not missing the bright pink her cheeks were flushed with. \n\n~~~\n\nThe sky was now basked in a strong tinge of warm colors, from orange, to pink, to yellow, and even purple if one squints hard enough at the horizon. As in response to the sky’s change, the clouds followed suit, tinging itself with lighter shades of purple, yellow, and pink. \n\nAs the sun prepared itself for slumber, two figures were sitting at the front porch of a wooden house, basking in the sun’s last rays before night befell all of Teyvat. \n\n“So Morax,” Guizhong turned to her partner in crime for the day. “How did you like today?”\n\nTo her inquiry, the man in question further relaxed his shoulders, his arms resting behind him, serving as a stand as the rest of his tall body leaned back.\n\n“I enjoyed it,” he responded as he looked to the horizon.\n\nGuizhong smiled at him, before joining him in looking to the horizon as well.\n\n“I’m glad,” she sighed blissfully as she closed her eyes, letting the celestial body’s rays warm her face.\n\nAs Zhongli’s gaze came back to her, he was taken aback by how peaceful his counterpart looked at the hands of golden hour. \n\nAlthough gods like themselves could take on any form they wished, he couldn’t help but think how well the God of Dust’s chosen form fitted her. Her long, silky hair was sprawled behind her back. Under the sun’s rays, it looked golden, bordering a light hue of orange. Her face had a hint of serenity to it as she basked under the sun, brown eyes lidded with delicate lashes crowning its edges. \n\nMorax had probably been staring for too long as Guizhong had come to sense his gaze on her.\n\nShe turned to him, head tilting forwards in puzzlement, silently asking him, ‘what is it.’\n\nHe shook his head, ‘nothing’.\n\nAt his verbal-less response, she raised her eyebrow, seemingly continuing their silent conversation.\n\n‘Are you crazy?’\n\nMorax ignored her facial expression. \n\nGuizhong broke their silent conversation and asked aloud, “So are you at least more fond of ‘weak’ humans now?”\n\nHe smiled at her and lightly nodded, “It seems my expectations for them were lower than should be.” \n\nGuizhong’s eyes widened, an elated smile quickly crept its way to her cheeks, proud of her accomplishment. \n\n“And…” the male started.\n\n“If you are still willing, I’ll be the brawn to your brains.”\n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nI wonder, do the people of Liyue still remember you? \n\nAre they grateful that an adepti as intelligent, elegant, and kind as you had poured in so much to help their pitiful species?\n\nDo they remember the you who was friendly and welcoming to them, the you who had befriended them, the you who was as affectionate as you were to them? \n\nOr perhaps they have all forgotten. \n\nAm I the only one that recalls your existence? Does the memory of you haunt their subconscious as much as you do mine?\n\nDo they miss you as much as I do? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌼 3. Until We Meet Again\n\n\"Fortify the bones, that movement be supple when the time comes.\"\n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nIn the the eerily, yet comfy, walls of Liyue’s Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the scritching and scratching of a running quill can faintly be—\n“Mr. Zhongli!” a loud, high-pitched voice rang through the thin walls, permeating every hidden nook and crevice in the humble parlor. It was almost a yell, just not quite there yet. \nThe named person lightly groaned at the sudden call, annoyed at its unexpectedness, and frustrated at the new mark on his parchment paper. A quick glance and one could tell it was there, that it wasn’t meant to be there, but there it was— intrusive and permanent. \nDeciding there was nothing he could do, Zhongli set the quill down on a cloth beside the parchment, already spread open, waiting for the quill. \nAs if on cue, a head popped out from behind the wall (but really, it was a folding screen, pretending to be a wall— but hey— it does its job quite well so who was he to complain?). \n“I’m sorry, was that too loud?” Hu Tao, manager of the funeral parlor, inquired. \n“Quite so,” Zhongli looked up at her. “A… less subtle warning would have been welcomed.”\nHu Tao sheepishly smiled at his hint but disregarded it altogether in the seconds that followed.\n“Well, the traveller, Paimon, and Mr. Childe are waiting for you outside.”\n“Tell them I’ll be a little later.”\nHu Tao blinked at him.\n“They’re literally already here. Outside. Waiting for you,” with her arms now folded, she continued. “Should I at least invite them in? For some tea?”\n“How will I know you won’t poison them for more corpses?”\nHu Tao’s eyes widened, subtly pouting at what her underling had just said about her.\n“Since when did you have a sense of humor? I must’ve at least missed a few chapters— books even.”\n“When it’s necessary to have them,” he responded, eyes scanning the piece of paper beneath him up and down. “Found for effect and necessity.”\n “That made no sense.”\nWith eyes still on the paper, the (ex(?)) Adepti shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, leaving Hu Tao’s comment up for interpretation.\n“So how long are you gonna take?” Hu Tao started up again. “Should I just invite them in for tea?”\nTo her repeated inquisition, Zhongli stood up from his chair. After seemingly contemplating the decision, he took the parchment in his hands and crumbled it in his right fist.\n“It’s fine, I’ll be out now.”\nThe crumbled parchment was abandoned on the side of his desk, its content meant to be never revisited again. He’ll properly dispose of it later, when an out of place traveller, their even more out of place travelling companion, and an annoying Fatui harbinger weren’t just outside the doorsteps of his workplace.\n“Pff, took you long enough, Grandpa.”\nMaybe Hu Tao wasn’t an observant person, maybe she was too annoyed by the tall man— or maybe it was a little bit of both— but the subtle tense in Zhongli’s shoulders went unnoticed by the only other person in the room; the one who had called him an almost-too familiar noun. \n\n🥀🥀🥀\n\nGuizhong,\nPresent day Liyue is so very different from the Liyue we’ve come to know then. A lot has changed, some inevitably, some not quite so.\nThis is the first time I’m formally addressing you, by name, in my letters— well— to you. To be more concise, this time will be the first, only, and last time I’ll ever do so. On a related note, this letter will also be the only one I will properly end, by which I mean, I will sign it. \nThese past two weeks have been… different. I dare compare it to ‘when you entered my life’ type of different.\nIn such a short amount of time, I had come to meet several… rather peculiar, persons. And the thing is, they all remind me of you. I am not quite sure if this is Teyvat’s way of toying with me, especially after all these years, but as inconvenient and unexpected as it was, I don’t think I mind it. However, a small part of me doubt all this being Teyvat’s doing. You see, when they came to Liyue, it felt as if my consistent life was tipped, ever so slightly, from its equilibrium. And as subtle as that tilt was, it’s hard. Hard to not notice it— especially because if you’ve been working for centuries to get used to that… balance. And to have it all rerouted by the addition of a single person; I can’t help but think it a bit cruel. \n\nThe traveller— the one responsible for this all— isn’t from this world. If my memory serves me correctly, they have come to look for their lost sibling. A tragic tale, really. But it isn’t their sob story that attracted me to them, it was their will, their strength, their determination, and their love for their sibling. You can tell how strong of a familial bond they have. It’s something I quite envy, actually… but that’s between you and me. \nThe traveller’s companion, Paimon (I think), isn’t so much different. I don’t think she belongs to this world either. But how beautiful is that? Two foreign entities, seeking solace and companionship in the other. They are both quite far from home, but it seems to me that they have home in each other. I wish I had someone as close to me as Paimon is to the traveller… How funny that… a part of me thinks it could’ve been you and me.\nAs alien as both the traveller and Paimon are, it was a bit surprising to see that I am not their only acquaintance in this world. They must be really social— like you.\nChilde also tags along with them, following them around just like a dog would its owner. It humors me, honestly. I can’t help but notice something a bit off about him though. He works for Signora, someone I’ve been in recent contact with. And Signora works for The Tsaritsa, who just so happen to be collecting every other archon’s gnosis. And I’m looking to give mine up. La Signora and I have an ongoing contract… Regarding what, I cannot say. But if I know her well enough, she will keep her end of it for sure. And I will have to mine. Anyways, besides being a Fatui Harbinger, something seems a bit off about him. Even after all these years, I still have trouble putting my thoughts into words but it seems like… He laughs, quite a lot. Only to keep from crying. But who am I to assume? It’s not like I am being completely transparent to them either. Some things are to be kept between you and me. \nLastly, but surely not least, there’s Hu Tao, my manager. She’s only recently been my manager though, maybe about two weeks or so-ish. Remember our mora conversation and that one time you took honor in paying for me? Well, it seems like that thought wasn’t universal. It wasn’t like that at first though… but alas, as time passed, so did the traveller and Childe’s willingness to pay for me. (If you were to read this, you would be holding in your laughter right now. I know so. You do not have permission to laugh, by the way, so kindly keep holding onto it.) Out of everyone, I think Hu Tao… tops the category for being unusual. But she pays for me, which is why I can tolerate her and enjoy going out with her more often than the rest— I’ve only ever been really expressing the former. Now that I think about it, this ‘relationship’ reminds me of you and me.\n\nI highly doubt I’m kidding anyone, everyone reminds me of you. Perhaps it was their personalities that reminded me of yours, and ultimately you. Or perhaps I was so used to your qualities that I can’t help but relate them to you. But perhaps they were just a few of many qualities that attracted me all the more to you; and even after all these hundreds of years, those qualities that I found in you had attracted me to them. Maybe humans aren’t so bad. \nAnd maybe their feelings aren’t so bad either. I think I understand them a bit more now— human feelings. However, I’m far from being as adept at them as you are…\n\nEven then, I think I went ahead and loved you anyway. \n\nI still have a lot more time to figure this all out— feelings, I mean— even though it may be out of my right to do so… who ever knows for sure?\n \nI’m unsure when I’ll see you again. So I’m unsure when these letters will find their way to you. But let’s be honest, they’re more for me than for you. When the time comes, I doubt I’ll even share these with you… for reasons I will not disclose. But if I recall, our contract still stands, so I’ll have plenty more opportunity to find you when the time comes for me. I haven’t unlocked your puzzle… Even after all these years I still am unable to unlock the puzzle you have entrusted me with. I don’t think I ever will to be honest. Where did all my confidence go, I wonder. Please don’t answer that, it was a rhetorical question. You and I both know the answer to it: they left about the same time you did. \n\nUntil then, please wait for me where the glaze lilies bloom. No matter how long that may be.\n\nWith love,\nZhongli (Morax) — God of Contracts, Former (...Maybe? Who knows for sure? We’ll see...) Geo Archon \n\n🌼 4. Time Has Started For Me Once More\n\"To unite in ambition is to be steadfast and immovable for all time.\"\n🥀🥀🥀\n“There you guys are. What on Teyvat kept you so long?”\nJust as Hu Tao and Zhongli opened the door to the Funeral Parlor, a small, flying creature, greeted them.\n“Sorry about that guys, Zhongli had something to attend to,” Hu Tao smiled at the awaiting trio, half apologizing for her employee and half blaming him.\n“For making me wait out here in this weather, you owe me something delicious for dinner,” Paimon said, squeaky voice laced with impatience.\n“Paimon, we haven’t even had lunch yet,” a blonde person spoke up, almost scolding her.\n“My apologies, how about we go find somewhere for lunch?” Zhongli suggested.\n“Oh? And you will be paying for us, right?” a tall figure spoke up from the back.\n“That’s right! Zhongli has to pay for whatever we’re going to eat! He owes it to us!” Paimon spoke up, nodding furiously to agree with Childe.\n“Oh? If Zhongli is paying, can I tag along?” Hu Tao asked. “It’s almost time to close up for lunch break anyways. And Zhongli paying is something I wouldn’t want to miss for the world.”\nA series of chuckles and giggles erupted from everyone but the man of the hour himself.\n“If I must,” Zhongli started, visibly annoyed. “Can we consider chicken mushroom skewers?”\n“Hmm…” Hu Tao brought her index finger up to her chin, in a contemplating manner. “They’re quite… cheap. As this is your first time paying, can’t you be a bit more generous?”\nThe other three nodded vigorously, agreeing with Hu Tao, internally grateful for her outright manner as she asked the question they all had wanted to ask.\n“Negative.” Zhongli’s eyes narrowed down on them. “My net worth isn’t high.”\nHu Tao giggled at the response she was given. “Fair, I doubt you can even live a comfortable life with your pay.”\n“And whose fault is that?”\n“So chicken skewers it is?” Childe perked up. “I don’t know about you rest, but I’m getting really impatient.”\n“Is it the heat or hunger?” Paimon questioned, pointing to his stomach.\nThe traveller laughed, “It might be a combined effort of both, Paimon.”\n“Oh, you know me so well,” Childe flashed a grin at the traveller.\n“Shall we go then?” Zhongli asked. “My offer only stands for so long.”\n“Let’s!” Hu Tao said, pointing to the direction of the Liyue Harbor market. \n\nThe group of four— 5 if Paimon counts— made their way to the marketplace, basking in not only the sun overhead, but in each other’s laughter and excited chatter."

{"text": "Ding!\nChongyun preemptively looks up from his phone, away from the source of the sound. He surveys his surroundings, making eye contact with everyone who had turned to the chime of his mobile device— no doubt judging him. Every pair of eyes he made contact with, he would flash them a sorry smile, polite (and fake) to the point of painful. \nNot counting the curious onlookers blocked from his peripheral by the many many bookshelves lining the library walls, he was sure he had silently apologized to everyone; but it wasn’t like he was keeping score. Oops, sorry about that. My bad!\nTo everyone but the person across the table from him.\n“Seriously?!” Xingqiu hushes from behind his book, raised criminally high to shield him from the embarrassment that was his college roommate and longtime best friend.\n“I’m sorry!” Chongyun whispers back, now leaning over the table, shortening the distance between them.\n“Text from Xiangling,” he finishes his apology all the while shoving the blame to a certain short-haired girl. Whether his remark was intended as that or not is up in the air for Xingqiu’s internal debate.\nXingqiu rolls his eyes as a silent response, returning back to his waiting book.\nAfter he was sure that Xingqiu had forgiven him, Chongyun motions to his phone and switches the sidebar, silencing his phone for the rest of forever— or until he feels like switching it again.\nHe swipes to unlock it and checks for Xiangling’s unopened message. Messages.\n\n[Ramsay\nToday at 9:05 AM\nHey are you and Xingqiu free later today?\nToday at 3:32 PM\nOkay it’s ‘later today’ right now. Since you ghosted me, I’ll go ahead and take your silence as affirmation.\nill se you guys at the cafe across the amphitheater at 3:45 today, it’s something fairly important so pls be sure to make it :]\n]\n\n“Xingqiu,” Chongyun whispers as he brings his hand to his mouth, intending to redirect the flow of his words and drown it out from non-intended recipients (but it’s more so done for reassurance).\nAt his best friend’s request, Xingqiu looks up from his book and raises his left eyebrow. What?\n“Xiangling wants to meet with us at that one cafe today.”\n“When?”\n“At…” Chongyun lets his words trail as he looks down at Xiangling’s messages for the second time that day. “In, like, 5 minutes.”\nAt Chongyun’s response, Xingqiu shuts his book quite forcibly— something Chongyun flinched at.\n“And you didn’t tell me this sooner because?”\n“I didn’t see her message until just now.”\n“Right. You mean when you interrupted no one but every single breathing person in this room?”\nUnable to find the right words to respond to his friend’s remark, Chongyun flashes a light smile and lightly shrugs his shoulders. Sorry.\n“Whatever, it’s fine,” Xingqiu starts as he gets up from his chair, pushes it under the desk, and throws his backpack over his shoulders, book tucked in his hands. “We should get going if we hope to make it.”\n“Yessir.”\n\n————————————————\n\nChime.\nThe door to the campus café chimes, announcing the arrival of the pair as they step over the threshold.\n“Ah, there you guys are!” Xiangling cheers as she gets up from her chair to make room for the addition of two new guests at their small table.\n“Well, you two are late,” Kazuha says as he lifts his half-empty drink, meeting the straw halfway.\n“It’s fine,” Hu Tao interrupts. “Better later than never.”\n“Yup, now we can finally start our very important discussion!” Xinyan declares, preventing the group from straying too far from their intended reason for meeting in the first place.\n“Yeah, what did you guys want to talk to us about?” Chongyun asks, now seated between Xinyan and Xingqiu. “What’s so important that it got me in trouble with Xingqiu and more or less embarrassed the living shit out of me in front of everyone else?”\nAt Chongyun’s rhetorical question, Hu Tao raises her eyebrows in a half-amusing and half-tell-me-what-happened-later manner.\n“Don’t be dramatic Chongyun,” Xingqiu scolds him.\n“Well…”\nXiangling stops, gears turning in her head as she thinks of how she can execute her idea to her awaiting friends.\n“Since it’s near Thanksgiving time, I was wondering if you guys are down to hold a…” she stops, looking for the right word. “Dinner… party.”\n“Dinner party?” Xinyan asks from her spot questioningly. “Like one of those formal ones?”\nXiangling shakes her head.\n“No, an informal, friends-only type beat of dinner party.”\n“Oh, I’m in,” Kazuha says as he takes another sip of his drink. “Who’s hosting it though?”\n“That’s what we’re here to decide,” Xiangling replies almost smugly as she reaches into her tote bag, fumbling around for something. It was almost as if she knew what her friends’ answer would be, even before verbally confirming it; almost. \n“Here!”\n“What’s that?” Hu Tao asks, looking from Xiangling to the sticks in the girl’s hands.\n“We’ll gamble on it. The person who pulls the shortest stick is responsible for hosting it.”\n“Well, what if that unfortunate soul just so happens to be a roommate with someone else here?” Xingqiu hesitantly asks. Though he knew the answer, he felt the question should be asked regardless— in case he was wrong, which he usually isn’t, but just in case. \nXiangling smiles pitifully at him as she knew where he was going with his inquiry. “Then you should  help them prepare for the best dinner party ever.”\nTo her response, Xingqiu slumps further into his chair, hoping and wishing that neither he nor Chongyun draws the shortest stick. Unfortunately for him, with the two of them combined, the chances of doing so just so happen to be slightly higher than the rest.\n“Are we ready?” Xiangling asks as she prepares for the fateful draw and spreads out the sticks so her friends can easily pull from. “On the count of 3, everyone grab one.”\n“1…”\n“2…”\n3!”\nThe sticks in Xianglang’s hands began to disperse one after another.\n“So who’s got it?” Hu Tao asks, looking at hers, then to the rest of her friends.\n“I think… I did…” Chongyun mutters, squinting his eyes down at his as if trying to find the rest of its length— something he failed to do.\n“Let’s see,” Kazuha starts. “Here, compare it to the rest of ours.”\nSix sticks were put close to each other towards the center of the table.\n“Damn. Looks like it really is me.”\n“It’s fine,” Xiangling reassures as she reaches to pat Chongyun’s sullen back from where she sat. “You have Xingqiu, you two will be fine.”\n“I digress,” Xingqiu mutters, glaring at Chongyun’s shamefully short stick, his monologue cursing at the ill-fated thing.\n“I’m looking forward to the bestest informal dinner party!” Xiangling muses, choosing to ignore Xingqiu’s comment altogether.\nThe rest of the friend group nod in agreement, excited about the idea of dinner together and even more excited that it won’t be hosted at their respective abodes.\n“How about meeting at their place at 7:00 pm sharp on Thanksgiving day?” Xiangling suggests as she stands up, hinting at her departure. “Everyone’s free at that time, right?”\nXinyan, Hu Tao, and Kazuha nodded.\n“Seven is too late, how are we gonna do all the things we want to without pulling an all-nighter?” Chongyun questions. “How about you guys come at 6:00 instead?”\nXingqiu sent Chongyun a silent side-glare but it seems he was a moment behind.\n“I’m fine with that time,” Kazuha says— rather almost quickly. “What about the rest of you?”\nThis time, it was Hu Tao, Xinyan, and  Xiangling who nodded.\n“Cool! That’s that then,” Xinyan says happily. “I’ve got to go to my band now, see ya guys later!”\nWith that, Xinyan steps out the door, guitar strapped behind her back, patiently waiting to be strummed.\n“Kazuha and I have to go to the poetry club too,” Hu Tao adds. “Are you coming with, Xingqiu?”\nXingqiu nods his head. “Yeah, but I’ll be there shortly. You guys can go ahead.”\nHu Tao shrugs as she and Kazuha head to the door and out into the world of college club life.\n“I’m not as busy as the rest of them but I do have this new recipe I’ve been dying to try out,” Xiangling says as she takes a few steps away from their table, gesturing to the door.\n“Good luck guys!” \nAnd with that, the one responsible for the Thanksgiving dinner was out the door, shoulders free of any more responsibility for the occasion, as if she was only meant to suggest it.\nAt their friends’ departure, Chongyun hesitantly shuffles between the now empty seats.\nHe’s— once again— across from Xingqiu.\n\n————————————————\n\nAchoo!\n“Bless you,” Xingqiu calmly says, keeping his eyes on the road as he reverses from the local market’s (rather small) parking lot.\nChongyun mutters a sorry thank you as he reaches for his seatbelt in the passenger seat.\n“So what’s next on our list?” Xingqiu questions.\n“Uhh…” Chongyun starts as he unlocked his phone and opens the Notes app. “We put— and I quote word for word— chicken or turkey.”\n“What?” Xingqiu grimaces. “Were the past us really that indecisive?”\n“Guess so. But it’s really only just the us from 2 nights ago.”\n“So which one are we getting? So I know where to drive.”\n“Since it’s Thanksgiving, shouldn’t we go for turkey?” Chongyun suggests the obvious answer.\nXingqiu nods subtly, eyes still on the road ahead. “I guess so.”\n\n~~~\n\n“Alright, we’re here,” Xingqiu states rather adamantly as he puts his car in park. “You can go in and buy it.”\n“Alrighty,” Chongyun says as he reaches for the door and opens it. “Be back in a bit.”\n“Make sure you close the door on your way out,”  Xingqiu lightly says as he reaches for his book tucked under the armrest.\n\nHe barely turns the page before—\n\n“Hey so uh…” Chongyun says, opening the door, rather hurriedly.\n“Hm?” Xingqiu looks up from his book. “What’s wrong?”\n“There’s like,” Chongyun hesitates before continuing. “A protest against the turkey-selling place.”\nWith the passenger side door fully opened, Xingqiu can hear what Chongyun was alluding to. He turns over his shoulder, looking for the sound. \nLo and behold, there the group was. Sign-raising, yelling(?), and protesting.\n“Quite admirable,” Xingqiu thinks his thoughts aloud.\n“Right,” Chongyun agrees hesitantly as he leans into the car, right hand over the hood (which Xingqiu totally finds attractive but that’s to be kept to himself till death renders it unshareable to the rest of the unknowing world).\n“Are we still up for turkey?” the sky blue-haired boy asks, unwilling to get back in his seat.\nHe contemplates for a second.\n“Y’know what, never mind,” he corrects himself and steps into the car, strapping in his seatbelt once again. “We should reconsider.”\n“Huh?” Xingqiu looks at him questioningly. “You’re not getting the turkey? No one in the group is vegetarian ya know.”\n“Yeah but… it would be weird.” \n“How so?” Xingqiu perks his head to the side, failing to catch on.\n“Because they’re literally right at the entrance. If I  were to go inside and come back out with fresh turkey then that would just be awkward.”\nXingqiu takes a moment to respond, no doubt considering what his best friend had said. \n“I guess so, but why does it even matter? Yes, they’re commendable for protesting but we still need our fresh turkey. And they’re not stopping us from getting it. Not to mention it’s Thanksgiving.”\n“But can’t we get it somewhere else? I’m not going in there. You can go.”\nXingqiu deadpans at Chongyun’s response, the familiar feeling of pettiness surging back into him. “Fine. I’ll drive us back to the market. You’re going in. It was you that got us in this mess in the first place.” \nChongyun rolls his eyes at the proposed ultimatum.\n“Fine— but just so you know, we already lost the draw when we became roommates. The odds were against us.”\n“Whatever, I just hope the market turkey is as good as the one here,” Xingqiu mutters as he hesitantly turns on the left signal and puts his car in drive.\n“Else we won’t hear the end of it from our resident chef.” \n\n————————————————\n\nHuff.\n“Can you sigh any louder?” Xingqiu berates his roommate as he places his grocery bag next to Chongyun’s on the small counter of their apartment.\n“Apologies kind sir,” Chongyun sarcastically replies. “I will keep my fatigue-ness in check the next time I’m around your divine presence.” \nXingqiu rolls his eyes as he works to clear the paper bag of its contents. It was just another day living with the sky-blue-haired boy.\nChongyun works to do the same.\n“Alright,” Xingqiu starts as he opens a cookbook he had found on one of the cabinets of their kitchen, flipping through the pages. “Should we start with setting up the plates? Since it’s simple to do so?”\n“Paper plates, right?” Chongyun verbally confirms as he unwraps the paper plates and plastic utensils from their respective packages.\nXingqiu nods as he continues to flip through the pages, looking for their desired dishes: roast turkey, mash potatoes and gravy, egg rolls, crystal shrimp, golden shrimp balls, and ice cream for dessert. Excessive? Maybe. Necessary for a good night? Definitely. \n“Xingqiu.”\nThe named man looks up from the open book.\n“How many sets do we need? 6 right? Kazuha, Xinyan, you, me, Xiangling…” Chongyun trails off, counting the names of guests on his fingers.\n“And Hu Tao, so yeah, the 6 of us,” Xingqiu responds. “But can you add one more? I invited Albedo as thanks for helping draw the cover of my last novel.”\n“You and your book nerds, got it” Chongyun verifies as he takes out another set for the seventh person.\nXingqiu shrugs nonchalantly as he works to flip through the rest of the cookbook, marking every recipe with a post-it note.\n\nThe clock strikes 1:00 pm.\n\n“I’m done setting up the plates, are we ready to get the show on the road?” Chongyun steps back into their small kitchen.\n“Yeah. For the most part, we are,” Xingqiu looks up from the book.\n“I’ll split up the courses and assign us to one of each so we can finish faster,” he proposes. “Take out your phone and take a picture of the ice cream, egg rolls, and crystal shrimp recipe.” \nOn Xingqiu’s command, Chongyun leans in to take a picture of all the recipes verbally listed.\nAway from Xingqiu’s knowledge (until he decides to open Discord and check for himself), Chongyun snuck a text to the group.\n\n[monky shrine - 6 Members\n\npopsicle boyo Today at 1:01 pm\nYou guys are def not rdy for tonight kaka :blushes:\n\nWalnut is typing… \n]\n\n2:03 pm.\n\nAs the two cooks, the childhood friends found a steady rhythm to work with— in the small kitchen that would’ve made it harder if they were anything otherwise.\nThe speakers are turned on to max volume, blasting Chongyun’s Spotify playlist: fever dream. (The fact that Chongyun used his phone for only music in the kitchen irritated Xingqiu. It means that he isn’t following the recipe; that he wasn’t following the book and its step-by-step instructions.)\n“We should turn it down before we get another noise complaint.”\n“It’s fine, it’s Thanksgiving, I’m sure they’ll spare us a night.”\n“It’s exactly because of Thanksgiving that we should spare them a night,” Xingqiu corrects and smacks his partner-in-crime’s shoulder with the unused whisk in his hand. \n\n3:15 pm. \n\nTheir first two dishes are done: egg rolls and golden shrimp balls.\nIt is also then that Chongyun decides to add himself to the percussion section of whatever song was playing (still on max volume— much to Xingqiu’s displeasure). \nXingqiu looks over at him, flabbergasted at his friend’s audacity to take a break when only one-third of the promised menu was done. \n“Why aren’t you washing your shrimps for your next dish? Why are you banging our chopsticks against our wine glasses?” Xingqiu cringes. Anytime now, and they will crack.\n“Because Xingqiu,” Chongyun quips, voice laced with an ‘as-a-matter-of-fact’ tone.’ “You can only reach the various notes with wine glasses.”\nXingqiu sighs in disappointment, unwilling to question any more. \n“Er— well— glass in general, but we really only have the former.”\n\n5:27 pm.\n\n“Turkey progress?” Xingqiu asked a tad bit too loud (but the still maxed-out music was to blame for his slightly higher-than-normal octave). \n“Uh,” Chongyun leans down to the oven, checking for the remaining time. “Half… an hour?”\n“Yeah, half an hour— that is— if we don’t mess it up,” he double-takes. “Which I don’t think we will by the way, but yeah. Just in case.”\n“Right. Just in case,” Xingqiu echoes in an awfully relaxed manner— as if Chongyun hadn’t suggested the worst possible outcome for the night.\nXingqiu looks down at their checklist on the counter (something he insisted they needed right after they already got through half the menu).\n“We still need to make the ice cream and pour the wine,” he scrunches his nose at the list then to the clock overhead, internally noting the little time they have left.\n“I can pour the wine,” Chongyun proactively offers, already rummaging through their bottom cabinets, no doubt looking for the finest wine they have to offer.\n“I’ll go ahead and get started on the ice cream then, it shouldn’t be that hard anyway.”\n“Don’t jinx it, ” Chongyun mutters between a smirk from where he is, standing on tiptoes to reach their highest cabinets (because he couldn’t find the wine in the bottom ones). \n\n5:55 pm.\n\n“Okay,” Xingqiu says aloud, checklist and pen in his hands. “Wines are poured, turkey nearly ready, ice cream…”\n“You mean cream,” Chongyun corrects from across the counter, whisking the bowl of ‘ice cream’. “There’s no ‘ice’.”\n“Well whisk harder? Maybe put it in the freezer?”\n“That’s now how it works. If anything, I think I whisked it too hard.”\n\n5:56 pm.\n\n“We should make it from scratch again,” Xingqiu says hurriedly.\nHe’s now back in the kitchen, looking through their fridge for any leftover ingredients.\n“Dammit, we should’ve said 6:30 instead of 6:00…” Chongyun curses under his breath as he puts the bowl of heavily-whipped cream in the sink.\n“Not we. Need I remind you whose fault it was?” Xingqiu says, feeling his anger from 2 days ago resurging.\nXingqiu’s head is still in the fridge before he starts again, “By the way, we don’t nearly have enough ingredients.”\n\n5:57 pm.\n\n“What? No, let me check.”\n“I already said we don’t,” Xingqiu slaps Chongyun away from the fridge. “Take my word.”\n“What do we do then?”\nXingqiu opens the freezer.\n“There’s like… an unopened box of drumsticks. We can use them for dessert instead,” he suggests, reaching his hand in the freezer to fumble for it as it was all the way in the back. “Why didn’t I know about this unopened box of drumsticks? Oh god, is it expired?”\n“Ah… I take credit for that. I got it like half a week ago when there were no more popsicles at the market.”\n\n5:58 pm.\n\nThe box of drumsticks is now in Xingqiu’s hands. He works to open the box and take out the content individually, stuffing them back into the freezer for when they will be eaten later.\n“Stop hovering over me and do something,” he quirks up. “Take out the turkey and plate it.”\n“Yes sir.”\n\n30 seconds until 6:00 pm.\n\nWith all their work done, the pair are now, once again, across the kitchen counter from each other. Chongyun looks at his roommate checking the last items off their list.\n“You know,” Chongyun starts, leaning and sprawling his hands over to the other side of their small, fake-marble counter. “For an informal dinner party, today was pretty stressful.”\nXingqiu hums in affirmation as he slides the completed checklist into the counter drawer.\n“But you know,” Chongyun lightly starts up again, refusing to end their verbal conversation to Xingqiu’s half-response. “I sort of like it. The idea of you and me hustling to get everything done.”\nXingqiu looks up.\n“And I think…” Chongyun looks away for a split second, finding the appropriate words to voice his thoughts with. “I look forward to the rest of our future. Like— graduating, working, living, and growing old… together.”\nXingqiu holds his eyes.\n\n6:00 pm.\n\n“Is that weird?” Chongyun suddenly doubts himself, releasing their eye contact as he feels a tinge of a blush coming to his cheeks. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for it to be.”\n“No. No, it’s not weird at all,” Xingqiu says, finding his voice (and Chongyun’s eyes) again. “I— I think I would like that too.”\nTo the reassurance, Chongyun’s smile opens, “I’m glad.”\nAnd for the first time in a while, the navy-blue-haired boy remembers what it means to blush.\n\nDing.\n"

{"text": "In which Jack is lost and alone and desperate for something—someone—to attach himself to and Elsa thinks she can undo all the regrets in her life vicariously through others.\n\nTwo chairs are across from each other, in the middle of the small (but perfectly sized), teal-walled (but the color seemed fitting), empty (but with a few rare exceptions) room; and when he enters, she’s the only other person there—proud and rich and fitted in her white coat under the harsh, blinding, fluorescent lights—the kinds you see in horror movies—or asylums—he supposes. A flicker or two and it might as well have been one.\n\nThe blistered teal walls have begun to wear and peel long before he started coming here, long before his body neighbor thought that this was what he needed—long before he forgot how to breathe.\n\nHe lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and scrunches his nose when his next inhale holds tinges of weed and cigarettes and yesterday’s patients. \n\nHe turns right to her collection and wonders if anything had been added or removed—or replaced.\n\nThe shelves are filled with them; three or so rows of thick textbooks—the kind no one likes reading—arranged in a way that made sense only to her. He squints one more time; Psychology: How to Fix Someone. \n\nOh, how he hates coming here. \n\nThe heater is deafening and there’s a stickiness in the air and he’s already irritated at that, but she makes sure he can hear her. He parrots back her squeak of a greeting and beelines to his seat—assigned and spotless and centered.\n\nShe’s staring at him now—with that expecting look of hers. \n\nI can fix you, it says. \n\nBlink. Blink, blink. \n\nThe overhead lights dim, then flicker.\n\n“So how’s your day been, Jack?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“Anything fun happening?” She asks.\n\n“No, not really.”\n\n“Any friends you’re seeing?” She pursues. \n\n“Nope, lost touch with them some time ago.”\n\n“Any plans on making new ones?” She’s stubborn. \n\n“No, I don’t need them.”\n\n“Jack…” she doesn’t want to surrender. \n\nAnd really, what the hell is the point of this, even? This back and forth is fucking stupid. She’s trying—he can tell—to fix him. He thinks she’s going off of some chapter from that stupid book on that stupid shelf of hers.\n\nShe has a savior complex like no one else, he knows this. \n\nAnd he wants to laugh out loud at that: at the fact that she thinks she’s doing some good in the world that’s so much beyond her, that she’s on the same level as Super fucking Man. \n\nHe imagines himself standing up, interrupting her tangent on the good of the world and her mantras and promises of how it’ll get better if he would just give it some time. He imagines himself telling her to stop trying with him and trying with everyone else as if she’s some goddamn saint. \n\nHe imagines himself leaving through the door and leaving her hanging, stunned and confused and eyes so wide that the blue was tainted with a subtle hint of red. \n\nBut he doesn’t. He doesn’t and stays glued to his chair like all the other times. \n\nBecause no matter how much he’s hated—still hates—it, he knows that it’s a lot better than killing himself. \n\n“Yeah?” Even with all his imagined possibilities, he doesn’t have the heart to leave her hanging;\n\nBecause she’s the only one still trying for him; never mind it’s artificiality and the fact that she’s only caring because she has to—because she’s getting paid to. \n\nShe’s already known all of his deepest, darkest secrets and everything wrong (and right) about him, but she still takes her time reading him.\n\nHe never felt more like an open book. \n\n“What you need Jack,” she starts like she’s the almighty. “Is on the other side of this feeling.”\n\nAnd she almost convinces him she’s one too. Almost. “Well no shit, Dr. Arendelle.”\n\nShe gives him a look; a look disapproving of his language and the way he speaks to her. But she ultimately pushes the rims of her glasses up higher on her nose and sighs. “What do you want, Jack? What are you looking for, what is one thing you want right now.”\n\nHis eyes narrow and his lips thin. “You know what I want, Doctor. You’ve known it since the beginning.”\n\n“Jack, you know I didn’t mean it like that.”\n\n“Then what the hell else did you mean? You asked me what I wanted,” He was starting to lose himself and he wasn’t quite sure whose fault it was; hers for being so damn wise and all knowing and vague with him, or his for being so uncooperative and impatient with her. “And I answered. I fucking answered. What the fuck else do you want from me Doctor?”\n\nShe stares at him like he’s lost it.\n\n“Or was I too vague for you?” Then, “I’m sorry, let me be more clear.”\n\nHe enunciates the word ‘clear’ so well that he is sure no one had done it better. \n\n“Well, Doctor,” he leans forward, getting as close to her as he can and stares her dead in the eyes.\n\nBlue on blue. \n\n“The thing I want most right now, is to travel back in time and fix everything. To redo everything I did wrong and fucking fix every regret I have.”\n\nHe expects her usual: a stare and sigh and some wise mumbo jumbo nonsense she probably has saved at the back of that smart head of hers to recycle on her patients who were all going through the same damn thing as him. \n\nReally, Jack is aware his situation is not special. That he’s just another sad person who lost his family in some tragic way and can’t seem to get his life right ever since. \n\nNot like he ever tried. He more or less died the same time they did. Difference is, he’s just not six feet under yet. \n\nBut the last thing he expects from the dignified woman across from him was a snort, a hand to her mouth,\n\nAnd a display of hysteria. \n\nShe laughs as if she'd just heard the funniest fucking joke in the whole goddamn world, and he smiles awkwardly as if he just didn't fucking yell at her.\n\n\nChapter 2: another day,\n\nThe next time he sees her is Wednesday.\n\nThey were back in her small, teal office. But instead of 2 chairs across from each other, it was 5 arranged in a circle. \n\nJack is the first to arrive. \n\n“How’s your day, Jack?” She asks as if their Monday session didn’t happen at all. \n\nHe sucks in his cheeks and searched his brain for a response. “It’s… good.”\n\nShe opens her mouth and laughs a little, “For some reason, I’m not convinced.” \n\nHe returns a small smile, “Well Doctor, it could’ve been better I guess.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nAnd before she can find something else to talk about or he can reply or before the awkwardness fully engulfs the both of them, the others trickle in; one by one by one. \n\n\n\n“How’s everyone been since last week?” she asks, tone laced with a little too much enthusiasm and made-up excitement and—dare he say—boredom and tiredness. \n\nSometimes he thinks she just doesn’t care at all—about any of them or—quite frankly—anything. \n\nBut he convinced himself he was making stuff up some time ago. \n\nShe’s a wannabe saint after all, so why would she pretend?\n\nBunny usually starts. “Actually life’s been looking up, Doc.”\n\nThis piques his interest. \n\n“That’s amazing Aster!” She ushers for him to go on. \n\n“I met this girl,” he starts in a singsong type of way—if  one heard him talk, they would know he was already falling for her. “Actually, we’ve known each other already—“ he laughs. “She’s been my dentist for the last 2 years or so.”\n\nJack’s eyes widen a bit and he digs his fingers through his jeans and into his thighs to keep himself from snorting out loud. \n\nThis is by far, single-handedly, hands down, their most interesting group session yet. \n\n“But recently, we got a chance to talk to each other outside of the office and—well—“ he was tapping his feet, a sign he was antsy or nervous or excited or maybe it was a little bit of everything. “We really hit it off.”\n\nShe smiles and he could see how white and straight and perfect her teeth were. “That’s amazing Aster, I’m so happy for you.”\n\nAster smiled. “Thanks Doc.”\n\nAnd Jack has a feeling that he wouldn’t see Aster at all soon, very very soon. \n\nAnd then he wonders; was that all it took to get them out of this hellhole? To make the world around them think they’re all better and happy and no longer drowning in their feelings and emotions and nonexistent expectations? Was all it took a girl? \n\nCause if that’s the case, then he should go look for one; he’s been told that he’s quite the looker after all. \n\n“Anyone else have something fun to share before we begin?” She tries again. She always opens their sessions with the simple questions.\n\nJack figures most people can give a simple or one word answer like him, but he started to notice that a few of them start opening up some more over the past few weeks or so. \n\nMaybe they just want to leave this shitty place, he guesses. \n\nOr maybe she’s changing them.\n\n“I moved back in with my parents,” Rapunzel says, all cheery and happy and excited for her new life. \n\nHe wants to join in with the others and smile and congratulate and be excited for her, but instead, he caughts himself biting his gums and thinning his lips and looking down at his hands—open and pale and at his mercy. \n\nBecause deep down, he’s jealous. Jealous and saddened and annoyed that he can’t—never again—have what she has. \n\nHe wants to scream at that. \n\nBut instead he shoots her a small smile, pained and faint and a little bit sincere. \n\nReally he is happy for her. \n\nBecause from their couple or so therapy sessions together—ever since he joined them—he knows she had had family trauma. \n\nShe deserves it, he thinks to himself. \n\nHe makes out her chatter from the other’s. “I’m so happy for you!” \n\nEventually the happiness dies down and Jack is relieved at that but then—\n\n“I got into the school my brother went to,” Hiro adds to the group’s little jar of shared happiness and good news. \n\nAnother series of applause and congratulations rotates around the group like clockwork; starting from her. \n\nAnd then a little while later:\n\n“Anything from you, Jack?” Aster asks, all well-intentioned and unintentional, but unaware. Painfully unaware. \n\nJack thinks Doctor Arendelle is a lucky person for having three good—amazing even—news from her patients when it just so happens to be the day of their group session.  \n\nBut he knows she isn’t that lucky. Because she went three for four. \n\nJack shrugs and hums a light no. Because after everyone’s contribution to their imagined happiness jar, he doesn’t—wouldn’t be—the guy to ruin their streak. \n\nHe’s a sad person, he knows, but not a bad one.  \n\n“Awe… well—“ Rapunzel starts but can’t finish. \n\nHe doesn’t blame her. \n\n“That’s fine guys,” she speaks up again to drive their attention to anywhere but him. “It’s about time we move on to the next part of our agenda.”\n\nHe makes eye contact with her and gives her a small grateful smile. She nods in return. \n\nJack closes his eyes and sinks into his chair as the people around him start to talk and listen, and talk some more. \n\nAnd his mind travels to that day, the day he lost himself. \n\nHe’s back to a winter he can’t seem to forget. \n\n~\n\n“Jack!” Emily yells at him from an arm’s length away. “Give me some!”\n\nHe laughs and pokes her nose and blows a raspberry at her. “No.”\n\nAnd Emily is going to cry—he knows it—her eyebrows are knitted together and her nose is scrunched.\n\n“I hat—“\n\n“What are you two doing back there?” Their mom turns around from her shotgun seat. \n\n“Nothi—“\n\nJack is quick, but she still interrupts him. \n\n“Jack’s not giving me a bite of the Big Mac!” She wines and her face contorts into an uglier, older, version of itself. \n\nAnd she crosses her arms for the extra added effect. \n\n“Jack…” his mom looks at him disapprovingly—amused, but disapproving nonetheless. “Please give your sister a bite of the Big Mac.”\n\n“She has her nuggets though?” He asks, bewildered and incredulous and ‘how dare she demand I give away a bite.’ \n\nHis mom sighs and looks to his dad for backup. “A little help here, honey.”  \n\nA chuckle follows and then, “You know Jack, your mom’s right.”\n\n“But it’s not fair!”\n\n“Well life ain’t ever is, son. You’re a big brother, Jack. You should share it, especially since it’s not that big a deal and especially since she’s your sister.” \n\nHis mom looks at his dad with love, his sister looks at him with an approving look, and he looks at his dad like he’s lost it. \n\n“Still—“\n\n“Jack…” \n\n“But—“\n\n“Give Emily the burger.”\n\n“It’s not fair, she ate all her nuggets!”\n\n“We know it’s not fair but—“\n\n“Fine.” He stretches his hand out and delivers the burger to Emily. \n\n“I hate you all.”\n\n“You don’t mean—“\n\n~\n\n“Jack!” Someone taps him and shakes him back and forth. “Jack, wake up!”\n\nHe winces and mumbles something. \n\n“He’s cold, he’s really hecking cold,” a curious boy’s voice. \n\n“But how can that be, he’s sweating…” a sweet female’s voice. \n\n“I’m telling’ ya mates, the dude’s lost it,” an annoying Australian voice. \n\n“Calm down, I’m sure it’s just a cold sweat, everyone,” an angel’s voice. \n\n“How much you wanna bet, Doc?” \n\nJack cautiously opens his eyes and looks around. \n\nHe grunts, “Why are you guys here? And all over me?”\n\n“Welcome back, Jack!” Hiro exclaims. “You haven’t been responding for a bit.”\n\n“We were worried about you,” Rapunzel added. \n\nJack succeeds in holding back his snort. \n\nBut he smiles instead, “I’m fine guys. Thanks though.” \n\n“Ahem.” \n\nShe interrupts them. \n\n“Well the session’s been over and Jack’s fine so I think it’s about time we wrap up.” \n\n“Sounds good to me,” Aster jumps in and checks his wristwatch. “I’m almost late for a meeting because of this.” \n \nAnd then he looks over at Jack, “It’s not your fault though, mate.” \n\nJack nods, in skepticism and confusion and everything in between. \n\n“Well I should get going too,” Rapunzel adds. “Moving is really busy.” \n\nShe turns to Jack, “I hope you get better.”\n\nShe waves and leaves after Aster. “Welp,” Hiro pops the p. “I don’t want to hang around either, so…”\n\nHe laughs a little and looks at the both of them awkwardly. “I’ll see you guys.” \n\nAnd then it was just the two of them in the empty, teal room.\n\n\n“Are you okay, Jack?” She asks him, justifiably concerned. \n\nIt gives him hope that she was concerned—even if it was only pretending. \n \nHe sucks in the air and holds onto his next breath. “Yeah, I’m fine.” And he clasps his hands together and hopes she doesn’t notice them glistening with sweat. \n\nHe wonders if his face still holds signs of sweat too. \n\n“Are you sure?” She doesn’t seem convinced but doesn’t pry either. \n\n“Yeah, I’m fine.” He tries to reassure her—or at least tell her that everything’s fine and that she shouldn’t worry and bother with him. \n\n“I see.” She smiles a dull smile and accepts his proclamation. “At the end of the day, you know yourself best after all.”\n\nHe thins his lips and, “Yep, thanks for the concern though Doctor.” \n\nShe bites hers. “No problem, Jackson.”\n\nHe walks out the door and notices it was twenty past seven—twenty past their session hours;\n\nNo wonder she doesn’t give a shit about him. \n\n\nChapter 3: an evening,\n\nThe next time he sees her is at a restaurant, him, ordering sushi for takeout, and her, eating by herself at the bar area. \n\nWell—she’s either by herself or with someone who is, at the moment, relieving themself or just isn’t there yet.\n\nShe turns and sees him first;\n\n“Hi Jack!” An airy greeting followed by a subtle flick of the hand. \n\nHe sucks in the cold, chilled, air around him. \n\nHe smiles back—holding onto his last thread of common courtesy and human kindness and frankly, ‘because his mother didn’t raise him to be a dick’—but doesn’t echo her greeting. \n\nFor what felt like an eternity in the waiting area, the waitress finally hands him his order of takeout. He’s thanking her as his head curses her for taking so goddamn long and he’s about to leave when—\n\n“Jack!” she calls him in between a laugh and waves at him to come over. \n\n“You know her?” The waitress asks him, giving him a look he can’t quite seem to figure out.\n\nHe wants to shrug but nods reluctantly instead. “Yeah… sorta.”\n\nShe’s my psychiatrist. He finishes in his head. \n\nThe waitress lets out a relieved sigh and beckons him to come closer. He obliges. \n\n“The woman had had a lot to drink already,” she starts. \n\nHe wonders what about him made her think he gave two shits about said woman. But he bites his lips and swallows back a groan and curls his toes in his shoes and into the ground to prevent himself from simply walking away with his only meal of the day. \n\n“Actually, truth be told…” he senses the woman’s hesitancy. “People have been complaining about her.”\n\n“Okay…” and he’s starting to understand where the woman is going with this. He can tell it from the way she speaks to him, the way she looks at him, the way she crouches so he seems a lot taller than he is compared to her—the way she submisses to him. \n\n“Is it okay if she goes home with you?”\n\nHe blinks in disbelief at her request. “I’m sorry, but I don’t—“ he stops midway to look over at the woman of topic—who’s slumped over her chair and mumbling some mumbo jumbo to the sorry person two seats away from her.\n\nHe sucks down an incoming hiss, “She’s not with anyone—anyone at all?”\n\n“Well,” The woman ponders for a bit before replying, “There was a man.”\n\nHe smiles. “Maybe ask him instead then, yeah?”\n\nThe waitress bites her lips. “Well…”\n\nHe was starting to lose his patience at her tippy-toeing around their conversation. “Well?”\n\n“He left her here… with us.”\n\n“Oh…”\n\nJack doesn’t know how he feels—or quite frankly—how he should feel; a part of him feels terrible for her, but another part doesn’t really care.\n\nAnd another feels like she deserved it. \nAnd really, that was just his pettiness speaking because at the end of the day; she was just doing her job, trying her best to talk to him and understand and fix him.\n\nAnd really, it was his fault for believing she could. \n\nHe lets out a defeated sigh and surrenders himself. “Sure. But you guys owe me a meal the next time I visit.”\n\nThe woman smiles and writes his name down for next time, “Jack. right?”\n\nHe nods.\n\nShe tucks a stray strand of hair behind her ear and smiles warmly at him; he notices the formation of pink on her cheeks. “It’s a nice name.”\n\n“Thanks…?” He looks at her weirdly, completely aware of her attempts at him but scrambles to do what he said he would. He waves awkwardly with the hand free of food and walks over to the oblivious girl at the bar a few feet away from him. “See ya.”\n\n“See you next time, Jack.”\n\n~~~\n\n“Doctor Arendelle.”\n\n“Hmm?” she sucks in her breath. “Is it morning already?!”\n\n“Doctor Arendelle!” The voice speaks again, this time followed by a gentle shake of her shoulders. \n\n“Anna?” Elsa giggles, eyes half-closed. “Is that you?” Then she slumps over again, “Why are you calling me that name?”\n\n“This isn’t going to work, is it?” The voice—the voice of a man— grumbles. She hears a light sigh and the next thing she knew, her face stopped flirting with the table and she was in the arms of someone whose voice her ears recognize but her mind can’t seem to comprehend. \n\nAt least he smells nice. \n\nChapter 4: A night spent together\n\nThis is crazy. Jack thinks.\n\nYou’re fucking crazy. He curses himself.\nIf someone told Jack this morning that he would soon have Doctor fucking Arendelle in his bed the same random Tuesday night, he would tell you you were crazy—or high, or both—and slap you in the face. \n\nHard.\n\nCause really, he would’ve thought you were crazy and that maybe—just maybe—you needed more professional help than he did.\n\nThat fact, in itself, was crazy.  \n\nBut here he is, Jackson Overland Frost, sitting in nothing but his boxers and sweats, chopsticks in one hand and sushi plate in another—afraid that the next bite would wake her up—and Doctor Arendelle—his fucking psychiatrist—laying in his bed, in her night blue, skin-tight, dress, in his studio apartment, in the far corner, restlessly moving and shoving and kicking around in his sheets. \n\nShe was ingraining her scent all over them. \n\nHe fights the urge to punch himself and scolds his mind for ever thinking—ever letting himself think—that. \n\n“Mmm…”\n\nHe freezes and feels his palms sweat and clings onto his plate for dear life because—\n\nBecause if the damn fucking plate drops… his life may as well have been over.\n\nJack then sees his psychiatrist try to lift herself up from his bed and he swears he almost pissed his pants. \n\n“Where am I?” \n\nHe hears her faintly mumble to herself, voice a little shaky and disgruntled, and everything in between. \n\nHe tries his best to stay still and unnoticed but she still senses him there. \n\n“Is there someone else here?”\n\nIt must’ve been her sixth psychiatrist-related sense; mindreading or something, he assumes.\n\n“I know you’re there.” He hears her shuffling around a bit more.\n\nYup, mindreading for sure. \n\nHe lets out the breath he was holding and steps into the moonlight shining through his window and surrenders himself to her.\n\n“‘Sup,” was all he could say.\n\nIn the light, he catches sight of her eyes squinting—probably to fix her vision on him and make out the mystery man.\n\n“Jack?” she questions.\n\nShe’s fucking psychic, he concludes.\n\n“The one and only,” he responds as he steps closer to her—to his bed. He knew she’s intoxicated and heavily under the influence right now, but he still treks with caution. \n\n“It’s so unbelievably…” she starts and wiggles around in his sheets, further cementing her scent onto his territory. “Hot…” \n\nHe can see her fidgeting around, struggling to do something. He couldn’t quite yet tell what though. \n\n“Jack,” she starts.\n\n“Hm?” His eyes wander all over her body, and he hates his conscience for stopping his gaze at her breasts; they were more voluptuous than he initially thought—but to be fair, the dress left little for imagination while her lab coat hid them well.\n\nHis throat runs cold as he notices a bead of sweat on her right mound. \n\nHe’s more than fucked. \n\n“Stop standing there.”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\n“Come and help get this dress off of me.” She groans and sways back and forth as he notices her hands wander…\n\n“What the—” He gasps and stops himself from saying anything more and just stands there, a few feet away from his bed. \n\n“You know…” She starts her drunk rambles. “For someone as fucking hot as you—” and tugs at the top of her tube dress. \n\nA sweat trickles down his forehead and he gulps as he claws his wet fists deep into the pockets of his gray sweatpants. \n\nHe was starting to get hot too. \n\nIt must’ve been the temperature that was bothering the both of them.\n\nHe should probably stop her. \n\n“Doctor—”\n\nShe sighs the sigh to end all sighs—a little exaggerated, extremely dramatic, and royally sassy, “Again with that title. Didn’t I tell you before, Jack?”\n\n“Uhm…” He wiggles his fingers in his pockets in hopes of wiping some of the sweat away. “Tell me what, exactly?”\n\n“To call me Elsa.”\n\n“You did?”\n\nShe stops and stares at him for a little bit—a little too long for his comfort but a little too short to deem her a creep—and proceeds to shrug. “Well—maybe in my dreams I did.” She mumbles the last part. \n\nBut it was a little past midnight, and with the streets—though they were nineteen floors below them—quiet, devoid of the typical road-raging driver and angry honks, it was hard not to hear her. \n\nHe gulps for about the tenth time that night.\n\n“Oh—” And even though she’s drunk and probably won’t remember anything a few hours from now, he’s still at a loss for the right words to say to the woman before him. “I—I see.”\n\nHe keeps his gaze on her as she (still) tries to strip herself. \n\nHe winces. “I don’t think you should do that.”\n\n“Why not?” \n\nAnd with that damned look on her face—he finds it a little bit hard to not lose himself. \n\n“You’re already half naked,” she comments and then giggles—like a fucking schoolgirl. “So really, what’s wrong, Jack?”’\n\nHe finds himself gulping for the hundredth (but really it must’ve been the eleventh) time that night—which he should probably stop doing because he was already dehydrated.\n\nElsa has a look on her face now, probably annoyed at his response (or lack of). “Stop standing there,” she beckons for him. “How many more times do I have to ask?” \n\nDrawn in by her voice in the middle of the night, with his mind too tired to fight back, and his heart, beating wildly and threatening to roll right out of his chest, Jack walks over.\n\nChapter 5: a morning after,\n\nThe first thing Elsa does when she wakes up is groan to herself. Her head spins at a pace where her conscience can’t keep up. She rubs her hand on the sheet, once, twice—and her eyebrows furrow into each other. \n\nThe blanket is a lot softer and thinner than what she’s used to every morning. \n\nWhen her brain finally catches up, she realizes that this isn’t even her blanket. Nor is this her bed—or her damn room. \n\nAnd then all at once, a feeling of pure, utter dread hits. All of a sudden, she’s sober again.\n\nNow her mind does another frantic dance with itself, trying to figure out that—if this isn’t her room (nor is it Anna’s) or Hans for that matter—then who did the room belong to? \n\nShe looks down at herself, her arm still tugging the thin blanket across her chest, and winces prematurely when she carefully opens it to reveal the rest of her body. To her relief, she was still in the same dress she left her house wearing last night—for the most part. \n\nShe takes a deep breath and then her wide blue eyes look; she doesn’t know what she’s looking for—hell she isn’t even sure if she wants to know—but she does so anyway because that’s, quite honestly, the most logical thing she could do given her situation.\n\nBut, for good measure, she pinches herself just to make sure she’s awake and that this is her reality. \n\n(It is.)\n\nWhen her eyes make it sixty percent across the room, she hears the person rather than sees them.\n\n“Finally awake?” A cool, crisp, almost teasing, voice startles her investigation. \n\nHer heart stops, and her face twists further into itself when she realizes—recognizes—who the voice belongs to.\n\n“Jackson?” She throws out randomly, not looking at him and crossing her fingers, hoping, that this was just someone who just happened to sound like her fucking patient. \n\n“At your service, Doctor Arendelle.” He gets up from the couch he was sitting at in his studio apartment and puts his coffee down, stretching. \n\nMotherfucking stretching. \n\nShe curses out, earning an ingenuine chuckle from the dreadful man. \n\n“Did—” she points between them, frantic and awkward and hoping. “Did something happen between us?”\n\nThis earns a laugh from him. At the end of it, she hears a funny “No.”\n\nShe must’ve had some doubts on her face, because he says some more, “I can one hundred percent assure you, Doctor, that our relationship as patient and doctor did not—and probably will not—cross that line.”\n\n“Then…” she sucks in a breath and asks another terribly unprofessional question. “Then how… how did I get here?”\n\n“The lady at the sushi restaurant more or less made you my problem,” he says, trying his best to make it seem like it is nothing to him—but from her experience as his psychiatrist, she knows. “Apparently the man you were with left… and never came back.” \n\nWhen she doesn’t say anything and takes the time to process, he adds, “You can ask her—if you doubt me—I wouldn’t take offense to that.” \n\nWhen he feels the need to explain and give himself an alibi, she only shakes her head, guiltily. \n\nShe fucked up. \n\n“Oh my god, Jackson…” her eyes widen more when they finally, actually look at him. “I’m so, so sorry about this. This shouldn’t even have happened. How terribly unpro—“\n\n“Like I said, Doctor Arendelle.” \n\nShe winces at his title for her and resists the very strong urge to slap herself. \n\nBecause this was so not happening. \n\n“It’s not a problem. I don’t mind helping you out, and you shouldn’t either, just take this gesture as something any acquaintance would do,” he says too cheerily and nonchalantly and for once in her life, she needs to stop psychoanalyzing him. “Or else it’ll make it weird—for the both of us.”"

{"text": "Tap, tap tap. \n“When I get home I want you~”\nTap, tap tap. \nJack thrums his fingers against his aged steering wheel, passionately singing along to the song, like he’s the only one there. \nPhysically, he is the only one there—here—in his 2007 light blue, Toyota Camry, but in hindsight, he’s not the only one—\n“Can you shut the fuck up?” Aster’s voice, annoyed and irritated and bothered (as always), sounds from the other side of his phone. \n “Just turn me down, dumbass,” Jack says into the device. And even though his best friend wouldn’t see it, he rolls his eyes for the sake of doing so.\nHe switches his lane on the freeway in the middle of all this. \n“Or, I can just hang up,” the Australian man replies, as a matter of fact. \nIt takes all of Jack’s self-control to withhold his annoyance at his friend—friendly annoyance, yes, never serious, yes—but still so damn annoying. \n“Bunny!” he exclaims into the phone, appalled at the threat, “Not on my big day! I need you for moral support.”\n“Or someone for you to keep yapping to.”\n“To keep me sane!”\n“Is it that big a deal, mate?”\nJack gasps, loud and clear even above the upbeat music and bass and drums blasting through his car’s old, tired speakers. “Yes, Bunny, it’s only the day I hear back from the job of the century, Bunny! A TA, imagine that!”\nA sigh comes from his phone, “Did they at least tell you what time you’ll hear back?”\nJack shrugs, but it’s not like Bunny can see him. “Nope.” He pops his p. “Only that it’ll be today.”\nAnother sigh, and then silence.\n“Like me next to you, and you next to me~and you next to—”\n“I said to shut up.”\n“Turn me down?”\n“Then I wouldn’t be able to hear you when you say something important.”\nJack wants to laugh, “When have I ever said something important?”\nA silence, and then, “You’re right.”\n“I always am,” a satisfied smile forms on his lips, even though he’s the only one to know. \n“Still, I mean it, Jackson, if you want me to stay on the phone with you, stop singing—at least not so damn loud—I’m trying to get this problem set done.”\nJack turns on his right blinker, successfully switches lane, and has just gotten off the freeway exit when he replies again, “Yes dad.”\nHe’s at a stoplight now, right blinker still on, waiting to turn. \n“I’m telling Toothi—“\nHONKKKK.\n“Oh—fuck. Shit!”\n\nAnd then Aster hears a loud and deafening beeeep. \n\nHis head hurts. \nEverything kind of sort of hurts. \nThere’s a slight ringing in his ears and he isn’t sure where it’s coming from. \n“Owowowow—“ he winces in pain as he fights the inflated airbag and his seatbelt and the door, all at once. \n“Oh my god!”\nThrough all the ringing he’s hearing—or imagining—an angelic voice makes it through to him.\n“I’m so sorry.” It says.\n“Are you okay?” It says.\n“Does it hurt anymore?” A pair of thin arms helps itself to him, wrapping themselves around him. \n“Shit, I should call the cops…” the voice says to no one in particular, him maybe but he’s in a state where he isn’t even sure if it’s real.\nOnce he’s out, he stumbles around a bit, but the same pair of arms help him find his balance, sitting him on the road against his car.\nHis mind is slow. \nBut it soon catches up.\nAnd he looks up.\n\nA pair of eyes so blue and bright looks at him—they dart all over him.\n“Yeah,” he manages to say when words find their way back to him, when his brain finally processes everything. “Yeah, I’m fine.” \nHe looks around him and takes the rest of the scene in. \nThe front of his car is fine. The back, however, isn’t as much—in fact—a fucking Bentley, is kissing its ass. His trunk is open, probably from the impact, and he sees what looks to be a dent: noticeable, but it won’t cost a leg and arm to repair. \nHe cringes when he notices the condition of its ass kisser though. The Bentley has a lot—too much—scratches and dents all over it. He squints and he even sees a faint cloud of steam coming from under its hood. \nHis eyes then trail to the girl hovering over him, and words are hard again, but by some miraculous nature, he manages, “The Bentley… maybe not as fine.”\nThen, despite the tragedy and unfortunate circumstance of the situation, “Battle scars are sexy, but not on a Bentley,” he quips.\n(But it’s more done out of a habit—Jack defaults to humor when he doesn’t know what the fuck else to do). \nAnd, with the combination of the accident, a pretty girl, the state of his car, and the state of her car (the terrible, terrible tragedy), he finds himself a sitting duck.\nHelpless and staring.\n“That’s good,” she says. “Stay here while I call the cops—and my parents—“\nHe notices the tapping of her baby blue kitten heels.\n“Oh god, what would they think—say?!”\nDespite being on the ground, and still a little dazed, he finds it in himself to console her worried self, “Relax, I’m sure they’ll understand.” And then he takes a look at the Bentley, “To some extent.”\nThe girl turns to look at him, her phone in one hand, mid-dial. “Do you know what happened?”\nHe shakes his head, but in the middle of doing so, he’s racking his brain for the memories, “I was making a right turn…” he thinks out loud. “Turning on a green…”\nHis mouth morphs into a silent ‘o’ as he looks at her again, eyes slightly wide. \n“Yeah,” she nods, lips thinning into a frown. Her eyebrows are knitted together as she confesses, “It was my fault… I was—“\nHe waits patiently for her truth.\n“Going a little too fast.” Then for no other reason (because she isn’t obligated to tell him the details), “I was going sixty. On a twenty-five.”\nHe doesn’t know what to say.\nI see? Nope, the conversation would die—and it’ll get awkward, he doesn’t want it to get awkward, because they’re stuck with each other until the cops come—and god knows how long that’ll be. \nYup, your fault. No, just no. \nSo he settles with just staring at her, waiting for her to call the cops, explain the situation to them:\n“Accident, yes. Between Towne and its freeway exit, yes. Hold on—“\nShe turns to him, who’s still on the ground. “Do you have your driver’s license?” \nHe nods.\n“Insurance?” \nHe points to his car behind him, nodding.\n“Yes, we both do,” she returns back to the call. “Okay, thank you so much.” \nBeep.\n“That was the cops,” she explains to him—probably because he was staring at her the entire damn fucking time. \n“I see…” He stands up, stumbles a bit, rejects her help, and continues  on, as cool as he can. “What are you going to tell your parents?”\nShe sighs, “The truth.” \nA short silence befalls the both of them before he pursues, “Why were you going so fast?”\n“I was,” a tinge of pink covers her cheeks. “Late to class.”\nHe blinks and tries—let it be known he really really tried—his best to hold in his laugh, but he fails. And it comes running out of his lips.\nThe girl is left standing there, speechless and most definitely—justifiably—shocked at what’s happening. \nHer eyebrows fold even tighter into each other by the time he pulls himself together. \n“Sorry, sorry,” he apologizes. “I wasn’t laughing at your reason, I was just—I just—“\n“Didn’t expect that?” She finishes for him.\nHe nods. “Yeah.”\nBefore she gets a chance to respond to him, they hear the distant sirens of the police. \n\n“Name?”\nJack leans against his car as he looks at the girl and the policeman responsible for getting her details. He had already been talked to, by another policeman, who’s to the side, writing some things down. \nHe plays with the gumwrap in the pocket of his favorite hoodie, twisting and twirling it around his fingers as he listens in on them (not because he’s creepy, but because he has nothing else to do, waiting—he already found time to respond to Bunny’s frantic texts). \nAwe, you do care, were the last words he typed and answered to his anxious friend.\n“Elsa. Elsa Arendelle.”\nThat name sounds familiar. \n\nEventually, Triple A comes, they figure out how much they owe him, the cops leave, and AAA leaves with her car—they told him that there were no fatal damages to his Camry and that it was fine and that fixes would only be for cosmetic purposes (to which he vehemently denied the need for, and which everyone agreed) and his trunk closed properly so all was well. \nExcept for the nervous beating of his heart, because 1) he realizes who she is: a rich heiress at the same university, in the same damn year as him, and 2) it’s just the two of them now. \nWhen he glances over at her, she’s looking down at her phone, fingers flying across her screen at probably two-hundred words per minute, texting—probably her sister, now that he knows who the fuck she is. \n“So…” he starts, waiting for her attention. \nHe continues when he gets it, “Want a ride? I was heading back to school too.”\nShe blinks, confused for a split second, but then realization finds her face. “You go to Northton?”\nHe nods, “Yup.”\n“Sure,” she says and follows him as he opens the passenger seat for her. For some reason, he can tell she’s not entirely present. \nIf it was bothering him, then Jack doesn’t dare voice it out loud as he wraps around to the driver’s seat, gets in, and closes the door.\nThey sit in silence for the entirety of the five-minute ride (because they were that close to making it back with no mishaps).\nJack’s right blinkers are on as he begins his turn into the campus parking lot when—\n“Finally, I remember!” Elsa physically jumps in her seat from his peripheral. And then she turns to him,\n\n“You’re Jackson Overland, right?”"

{"text": "\nTick. Tick. Tick. \n\n“So what are your bad habits?” The white-haired man leans further back into his bean bag as he tries his best to undo the much-too-tight knot at the base of his tie. He tells himself he should remind Tooth to not tie it so damn fucking tight next time. But he knows their conversation is going to end with her annoying boyfriend scolding him in his annoying Aussie accent. \n\n‘Be grateful you jerk.’\n\nOr, ‘Have your nonexistent girlfriend do it for you next time.’ \n\n“Uhm… Mister?” The strawberry blonde woman calls out to him, from across his makeshift office.\n\nBut really they’re just in the living room, with a mahogany coffee table, low enough for him to use it as a leg prop, separating the woman—who’s on the relatively old, relatively soft, couch—and him—on the bean bag he dragged out of his room to do this meeting comfortably on. \n\nIt’s at her call that he remembers he’s supposed to be interviewing her for the (most covetable) position as his roommate. He’s been a sitting duck, struggling to pay rent ever since his former roommate, Hiccup, had left him to live with his girlfriend. \n\nLike is he fucking kidding? He’d rather live with his girlfriend than his best friend? Really, Jack doesn’t understand at all. (And his friends tell him he never will, but if asked he would say he has no idea what they’re talking about because he—as much as his friends say otherwise—has rizz.) \n\n“I’m sorry—I,” he coughs to seem busy and tries to gather his thoughts. “What were you saying again? What was I asking again?”\n\nThe young woman blinks and starts to get up, “You know what, this isn’t going to work—Elsa, my sister—” \n\n“Your sister?” Jack mirrors her motion and gets up as well. “What about her? And why is she brought up again?” \n\nReal mature, Jack. Real fucking mature. \n\n“Oh yeah, I’m—I’m actually interviewing for her because she couldn’t make it today…” Anna sends him a small smile before leaning down again to grab her purse on the low table between them. “But you know… she’s very…” she looks around for a bit, refusing to make eye contact with Jack. “Specific about the people she wants to live with.”\n\nJack blinks in confusion. \n\n“So I’m sorr—“\n\n“Wait,” Realization dawns on him as he finally catches hold of the pity on his interviewee’s face. “Are you… rejecting me?”\n\n“…”\n\n“As the person I’m interviewing?”\n\nAnna gives him a scared look and she mouths a weak, silent, ‘I’m so sorry’. \n\nFor whatever reason, she decides to stand there though. Maybe because she regrets getting up on him or maybe because she’s a really nice girl and can’t fathom the idea of leaving him hanging. \n\n“So… you’re interviewing in place of your sister… Elsa, right?” Jack tries again with her. “I’m sorry that was—I was just lost in my thoughts for a bit, I’m sorry.”\n\n(And despite apologizing, he lowkey thinks she’s a little bit crazy for deciding that living with him was a bad idea because he zoned out a smidge.)\n\nJust a smidge. \n\n“Oh no worries, I wouldn’t care,” she tells him as if she has access to his thoughts. “It’s just that—my sister… Elsa…”\n\n“Elsa…” Jack repeats after her, urging her to go on about the reason—the person—why she almost leaves him hanging for. (He’s totally aware that this isn’t a date or whatever though, or even close to one at all, but still). \n\nBut still…\n\n“She’s… mmm,” Anna’s thinking really hard. “How do I say this…” \n\n“She can’t be that bad, right?” And really, does he want to know? What if it’s something really bad or really gross or really… wait what if she’s a fucking murderer or something. Maybe he should just let the woman leave. \n\n“No!” Anna shouts to save her sister’s reputation. “It’s not what you’re thinking it is.”\n\nHe’s convinced she’s a mind reader. \n\n“Then what is it?” He asks casually, hoping she doesn’t catch a glimpse of his sweaty palms or hear the waver in his voice. \n\n“She’s just very… proper. Prim. Sophisticated, elegant, technical… clean…”\n\nJack can’t decide if she’s insulting him or if she means it. He finds the latter hard to believe though, because how can anyone really be all that? If he didn’t know better and if they weren’t living in the 21st century, he’d have thought she was describing a queen.   \n\nBut he can’t give this Elsa person up either, because— quite frankly—he doesn’t want to be living off of instant ramen and pizza anymore. Quite frankly, he kind of wants to enjoy his weekends not alone and at home just because he has to be mindful of his spending.\n\n“Tell you what… how about you tell this Elsa sister of yours, to text me…” he drawls on as he scribbles his number on the paperwork (it was just one page that he typed up the night before to sell the lie that he’s a professional) and slides it over to her. \n\n“And we can set up a meeting time when she’s free.” \n\nAnna sighs a sigh of relief and Jack guesses it’s because she doesn’t have to walk out on their interview. \n\n“Yeah, of course,” then a wide smile forms on her lips. “And who knows, maybe the next time we see each other, I’ll be your housemate’s sister instead.” She says casually to clear the tension—or whatever this awkwardness was—between them. \n\nAs they finish their goodbyes, Jack hopes the next time he sees the giddy woman, it’ll be under different, less awkward, circumstances. \n\nHe realizes he doesn’t even know her name. \n\n~~\n\n“You told him what?!” the woman looks at her sister from across their dinner table, justifiably perplexed and horrified. Her last spoonful of pasta doesn’t even make it into her mouth.\n\n“Well…” the younger woman reflexively leans back into her chair and she looks at her husband, Kristoff, for help, to which he pretends he doesn’t see her.\n\nShe sighs, “I told him that it would be better if you guys met… after all, Elsa… It’s sort of your living situation.” She gives a small laugh to take her point home, “You know what I mean?” Awkwardness and all.\n\nElsa sighs a defeated sigh, “Well, I guess you’re right.” Logic and reason have always made sense to her. \n\n“Great!” Anna’s smile finds its way back to her suspiciously soon. “From the ten minutes I’ve met with him, I just know he’s going to be a great housemate.” \n\n“Ten minutes… alright…,” Elsa forces a smile and forces her terribly irrational self to trust her sister’s words. \n\n“And here’s his number,” Anna slides the paper she had with her across the table, beckoning for Kristoff to help her pass it over to his sister-in-law. “On the top right corner.”\n\n“I see…” Elsa says as she eyes the paper up and down. “So do I give him a call? Or text?”\n\n“Either’s fine, I think, he seems chill enough for a text,” Anna recalls her encounter with the white-haired man. Then, her eyes light up, “You know, he’s actually pretty cute…” She starts but gets interrupted by Kristoff choking on his pasta, followed by a puppy-dog look from him.\n\n“Not cuter than Kristoff though,” She corrects herself between bites and giggles. “But cute enough for you, Elsa.”\n\nHer husband chokes on his food for the second time within five seconds. \n\nHer sister gives her a look from across the table, and under the cozy, warm lamp overhead, she can see Elsa’s eyes twinkle a bit. \n\nHer smile opens in turn, “You know you’re interested, sis.”\n\n“Am I though? “Elsa’s expression turns into a skeptical one. “Last I checked… we have different types in men.’’\n\nAnna feigns offense but she still pushes for the supposed cute man she met, “No really, though. Like he’s genuinely your type Elsa… at least I think he is.”\n\n“Hmm…” Elsa looks thoughtful (and doubtful), but in consideration of her little sister, she plays along. “Tell you what, I’ll let you know if I think he’s cute. Honestly.”\n\nAnna groans at this, “But you never let me know when you think anyone is cute—heck do you even think anyone is cute?’\n\n“I told you I have high standards, Anna.”\n\n\nAnna gives her a devious look in return, “Well, I think this guy will be the first.”\n\n“Do you really think he’s that cute, babe?” Kristoff squeaks from his seat and laughter soon follows suit around the table. \n\n~~\n\nIt’s 10:05 at night when he receives a text from an unknown number. \n\nHe’s brushing his teeth, scrolling through his recent collection of liked songs on Spotify (ninety percent rap, eight percent LoFi, and two percent EDM—because his friend group partakes in raving sometimes). \n\n‘Hello.’ It reads. \n\nHis eyebrows fold into itself and his face contorts into an unreadable expression as he just stares at the text. Correct capitalization and punctuation. \n\nWho the hell texts like this? \n\n‘I got your number from Anna, I’m Elsa.’ \n\nHis face soon relaxes as he leans down to spit out the toothpaste in his mouth.\n\nOf course, it’s this Elsa person. \n\nHe kind of feels sorry for doubting Anna about how prim and proper her sister was.\n\nHe leaves her waiting a bit and decides that rinsing his mouth, drying his face, and then going through his three-step nighttime skincare routine has higher priority than responding to the text. \n\nIt’s 10:15 at night when he sends his response back to her. \n\nhey elsa, this is jack. the person you’re trying to live with \n\nAnd although he doesn’t really have the professionalism or the correct punctuation and capitalization like her, he at least, was proud of himself for spelling everything right. \n\nHello Jack.\nI will only be interviewing in *hopes* of living with you.\n\nThen,\nWhen would you like to arrange our meeting and where?\n\nJack stares at the text a little, deciding what he should say. Anna had warned him that her sister would be—is—a little professional but at her text, he’s imagining all kinds of things that can go wrong with someone like him living with someone like her. \n\nAs his brain works overtime—or works more than it even usually does—he sends her a text back nonetheless: \n\nah yes, madamouiselle Elsa, I believe I am free to meet with you two days from now, would Sunday at around 5 pm work? \n\nAt my house?\n\nHe sees her typing a response—the familiar three dots—but two seconds later, it disappears and quickly comes another text. \n\nAh yes, Monsieur Jack, I will be free Sunday at around 5 PM.\nWill there be tea and croissants?\n\nHe smiles. Maybe he can live with her. \n\nthere will be watever the brits or french have at tea time\nor watever… \n\nPerfect.\nI will be looking forward to it. \nSee you then, o’ great Lord Jackson of 2348 34th Street\n\nJack stares at his phone. He’s retired in bed now and his brain is working its ass off to come up with a witty—worthy enough—response. \n\nHe wants to say something that will continue their conversation, and give her more of a reason to want to talk to him over text. He wants to know more about her. But it’s been well over ten minutes and a response any later than that would be rude. So he just goes with the second-best option: \n\nperfect. I’ll see you then. \n:) \n\nA smiley face. A fucking smiley face. \n\nJackson Overland Frost doesn’t do smiley faces.\n\nBut whatever, he thinks. \n\nHe knows he’s overreacting over a five-minute text conversation, but he doesn’t sleep that night. \n\n~~\n\n“So what do you think of him?” Anna asks her sister on Sunday morning, five minutes before Elsa’s about to leave to go see him.\n\nShe skips her usual weird, skeptical look when she’s asked something prematurely like this and gets straight to her response as she works her left arm into her oversized blue-knit cardigan, “You should ask me after I come back, Anna.” She grabs her purse and keys from their counter and tucks her phone into her back jeans pocket. \n\nAnna doesn’t back down, “I know you texted him.”\n\n“Of course I did, you told me to,” Elsa rolls her eyes at the obviousness of it all. \n\nWhy is Anna so persistent? \n\n“I guess I did,” Anna shrugs on the couch as she puts another Royce Chocolate—something their cousin Rapunzel had brought back from her trip to Japan—into her mouth. “But still, did you enjoy your conversation with him?” \n\n“It was a five-minute conversation scheduling our meeting, Anna,” Elsa’s now fighting the urge to roll her eyes at her sisters’ curiosity—but honestly, she’s a hair’s length away from calling it nosiness. But because she’s a good older sister and she’s a respectable adult and getting upset over this is far below her, she doesn’t.\n\n“A lot can happen in a minute or two—much less five,” Anna says casually as she brings another piece of the yummy gooey goodness into her mouth. “Love at first sight is very real.”\n\n“Yeah but it’s unlikely,” Elsa says as she opens the door. Before closing it though, she squashes Anna’s logic (or lack of) with one more remark, “In fact, it’s very rare for that to occur, quite frankly, impossible even.”\n\nAnna says nothing more about it but through the now closed door, Elsa hears a muffled, “Have fun!”\n\n~~\n\nJack gruntles in his much-too-tight knot again and his right index finger is deep in the tie’s knot, wiggling around in it to get it right—or at least get it to lose enough so that he doesn’t die from suffocation, because how lame would that be? \n\nHe mentally cursed his past self for being so worried about his meeting—his interview—with Elsa, that he forgot to tell Tooth about leaving the knot a little loose. \n\nOr you can watch a YouTube video and learn how to tie it yourself. He hears the scold in a familiar, annoying, Aussie accent. \n\nHe doesn’t want to admit that he probably—really—should. \n\nHe grunts a little more in his bean bag chair and he’s getting a little sweaty, so he goes to turn down the air in his apartment.\n\nDing. \n\nAnd despite the air now being five degrees colder, he finds himself at least ten degrees warmer.\n\n~~ \n\n“Hello!” The door opens and out comes a man—a very tall, relatively lean, relatively built man—Elsa can tell, even under the light blue dress shirt he’s wearing, she can just fucking tell. His hair is even whiter than hers—and his eyes are a bluer, deeper, icier pair. \n\nShe gulps. And avoids staring at his thin lips and his (very sharp, very well-built, high cheekbones and all) jawline and his Adam’s apple. She avoids looking at the rest of his face altogether.\n\n“Madamoiselle Elsa, right?” He smiles a cheeky smile and she sees how white, how straight, his teeth are.\n\nShe hates to admit it, she really really does, but Anna’s right—this man, Jack, is her type.\n\n(And she didn’t even know she had one.)\n\nShe smiles and tries to be as professional as she can be given this newfound revelation. She extends her hand out to him and plays along, “Oui, it’s a pleasure to meet you Monsier Jackson of 2348 34th Street.” \n\nHe smiles again, along with a laugh this time. It’s a nice, cool kind of laugh—genuine and sincere. And it does things to her heart. \n\n“Ah yes, please come in,” he opens the door wider for her as he bows. “I’m afraid we ran out of the croissants, so tea and two-day-old cookies would have to do.” Then, “I’ll go brew some right now for you if that’s alright with you, Madame.” He says this in a very bad, very lame, very faux combination of British and French accents and it takes all of Elsa’s self-control and professionalism to not start laughing. \n\nShe’s the first to break their act, “No no, it’s alright, I’m ready to start the interview.”\n\nHe gives her a look, “Are you sure, Elsa?”\n\n“Yes,” she nods. “Any more and I’m afraid I’d be intruding.”\n\nHe shakes his head, insisting, “That’s okay, I’m technically the host.”\n\n“No, it’s fine.” \n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“Positive.”\n\n~~\n\nJack finally surrenders and walks from the kitchen to the coffee table. After a more formal introduction and a necessary handshake (for the sake of professionalism and for the sake that this is still a meeting, no matter how much he previously had wanted to laugh and joke around with her), he beckons her to her seat on the couch.\n\nHe’s on the bean bag again, like all the other times and with all his other interviews, but this time he feels a little bit insecure.\n\nAnd maybe even a little foolish. \n\nHe gulps a pathetic kind of gulp and tries to start the interview and the debrief but he has trouble making eye contact with her. (Let it be known he has never, in his twenty-three years of life, had trouble making eye contact with anyone.) \n\nGrowing up, he’s always known he’s been quite the looker—thanks to his sister, he’s even indulged himself in personal hygiene (not that he wouldn’t without her), skincare (she forced the daily use of moisturizer and sunscreen onto him), and style (she couldn't stand the sight of his blue hoodie anymore). Dozens of women (and men) have developed crushes on him over the years—he dated six of them for fuck’s sake.\n\nBut here he is, bumbling his summarization of the interview and paperwork and expectations and everything like an idiot. If he didn’t fuck up his meeting with Anna last time—who probably (definitely) told Elsa about it—he’d be labeled a bumbling fool after this performance.\n\n“...So yeah, that’s pretty much the gist of it.”\n\nGist? Gist of it?!\n\nHe wants to royally facepalm himself.\n\n“I see…” Her bright blue eyes are staring at the paper in front of them for so hard, so long, that he’s convinced she’s burning a hole into it. He wipes the sweat from his palms onto his trousers and hopes Grammarly has done its job and that she finds no typos. \n\nHe’s also self-conscious that it’s just one page—one fucking sided too. \n\n“Any questions before we start the interview?”\n\nShe shakes her head and he can’t help but notice a loose strand from her braid, lazily done and lazily slumped over her shoulder.\n\nIt takes all of him to not look too long at her exposed collarbones. \n\n“Jack?” She calls out to him. “I don’t have any questions, we can start now.”\n\nHe looks back up at her and for some reason—for some fucking terrible, weird, creepy, reason—he decides he can’t—that he doesn’t have it in him—to continue this goddamn interview.\n\n“Actually, we—I—can’t—” he admits, furiously swiping the sweat from his palms now. He even feels a bead trickling down his forehead. “I’m afraid this isn’t going to work.”\n\nShe looks at him, her eyebrows are knitted together and her lips twitch, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you mean—what do you mean this isn’t going to work?” She straightens her back even more (he didn’t think it was possible).\n\n“It’s just….” He knows why this isn’t going to work.\n\nBut he can’t say it. In what world, would ‘Oh I’m sorry, I can’t live with you because I’m a bumbling, stumbling, mess around you. I can’t hold a proper conversation with you without my palms getting super sweaty or my heart racing—I can’t even look at you without my eyes trailing to your collarbones or cleavage or something worse—be an appropriate answer?\n\nHe takes a deep breath and brings his head back to the dire situation he’s faced with.\n\nYou literally just met her, for fucks’ sake. Nor are you a sixteen-year-old going through puberty and experiencing masturbation for the first time. \n\n“I’m sorry, Jack,” she says. “But I would at least like to know what changed your mind about me…” she tries to get him to talk, and justifiably so.\n\nSo he opens his damn mouth and talks.\n\n~~\n\n“I’m so sorry, it’s just that I can’t live with someone I’d like to ask out,” he says in a hurried slur.\n\nElsa blinks. She processes his onslaught of words and she blinks again. Her mouth is slightly open and he’s looking at her.\n\nOh. \n\nHer lips had made the effort, and her mouth was now open, forming a very visible oh. But her vocal cords refuse to cooperate with her intentions. \n\nOh. \n\nA terribly awkward cough escapes him, before a, “Shit.”\n\nShe hears him mumble under his breath. And she sees him run a (sweaty?) hand through his tousled, messy, sexy white hair. \n\n“I’m so sorry Elsa—this—“ he points between them. She watches his finger as it points at her to him,  back to her, and finally back to him.\n\nThe odd nature of his confession and gesture finally makes its way to his head and he scrambles. “Oh god, I’m so sorry—this is so fucking—“\n\nHe cuts himself in between his apology with a brief, “How could you Jack,” which was meant to be unheard, directed towards himself. \n\nShe heard it anyway. \n\nAnd it takes all of the muscles in her lips to refrain from curving upwards.  \n\n“This is so unprofessional of me, I just—I don’t know what—“\n\nElsa’s voice finally decides to work, but it says something she hadn’t meant to—at least not so fast or so soon—or at all. It speaks without her thinking first. “That’s alright because I feel the same.”\n\n~~\n\n“You what?” He doesn’t know whether or not he’s donning a look of pure surprise or confusion, or both, or worse: utter horror. \n\nThe gorgeous woman on his sofa refused to speak further, but the new foreign look in her eyes betrayed her; he was so sure they looked like his—horrified and overwhelmed by the terrible mistake of her words. \n\nTo a much lesser extent though, give or take. \n\nHe licks his suddenly dry lips before continuing, “Alright then…”\n\nHe tries his best at professionalism—something he doesn’t do well with. “Since we both have said some—rather unfortunate…”\n\nThe silence between his gaps is sucking the soul out of him. \n\n“Since we both have admitted to something we shouldn't have,” she admits (which causes his eyes to round like dinner plates) and finishes his trailing sentence for him. \n\nHe bites his tongue to keep himself sane, “Right, thank you, Elsa.”\n\nShe nods. \n\n…\n\nHis head is still running miles—working overtime—to try and keep up with the situation—and the rapid development of it.  \n\nAlthough rare, if ever, it’s times and situations like these where he’s convinced himself he’s going to fucking murder ‘that damn motherfucker’ Hiccup.  \n\nHe hears her sigh from across the coffee table. \n\n“Well, s-since we both agreed on how our living arrangement…” She does the thing that he did just minutes before, the pointing between them. “Isn’t going to work… I better be going now.”\n\nShe brings her left arm to her face, and his eyes follow her movement. It happened quickly but Jack had seen it.  Under her oversized, mushroom-like sleeve of a cardigan, he realizes she isn’t wearing a watch. \n\nWell isn’t this just awkward for the both of them. \n\nYou should have just shut your damn mouth, Jackson. \n\n“Jack?” Her crystal clear voice calls out to him again. \n\n“Ah—right,” he forces a laugh out of himself to try and convince her that—although he’s a bumbling idiot—he’s not a total, complete, unaware fool. \n\nHe may well be on his way there though. \n\n“I promise I’m not like this normally—running my mouth when I don't mean it.”\n\nHe could’ve said his goodbyes and he could’ve led her to the door, wave her off, never see her again and pretend none of this ever happened, but instead, he tries to save it. \n\nWhatever it is. \n\n“You didn’t mean it?” Her face drops and she looks at him quizzically. \n\nHe actually facepalms himself now. \n\n“N-No I meant—I meant I didn’t mean to.”\n\n“You didn’t mean to say it because you didn’t mean it?”\n\n“No, I didn’t mean to say it out loud.”\n\n“So you didn’t mean to say it out loud because you didn’t mean it?”\n\nThis woman is going to be the death of him. In the worst, and possibly the best, way possible. \n\n“No Elsa, I—“ he sighs because he didn’t think there would be more weird creepy confessions this afternoon, but alas, he had to jinx it, because another one’s about to come out of his damn mouth. “I think you’re gorgeous—so gorgeous and beautiful, and I can tell it’s not only your looks that are beautiful, so please don’t think I’m shallow.”\n\nHe pauses to catch his breath but also to take her face in. She’s looking at him, with her mouth forming that familiar ‘oh’ shape he’s pretty much used to by now, her bright blue eyes are shining brighter than he’s ever seen it—maybe because of the bits of sunlight filtering through his curtains. Her braid is also catching the light and it’s practically glowing. \n\nHe continues when he catches his eyes trailing to her collarbone. “So I had meant it—and I still do think so. But I didn’t mean to say it out loud… especially not to you.”\n\nIt takes her a good five seconds to respond to him and he winces on the fourth. \n\n~~\n\n“I-I see,” she finally says. “Well, I’m—I’m very flattered, Jack.”\n\n He nods a rather measly—defeated(?)—sort of nod. \n\nShe didn’t know what to say or do anymore after she thanked him. Elsa knows she shouldn’t be impulsive and every last bit of logic and reasoning is screaming at her not to, but she does it anyway. \n\nShe tells him her truth. And tells herself that it’s only fair because she has heard his. \n\n“Thank you for your honesty.”\n\nHe doesn’t look at her and just nods. \n\n“I also—“She looks at his hands and begins to grow hot because she sees how well-defined and firm and long his fingers are. \n\nShe also gulps at the snowflake tattoo on the side of his wrist. (It’s a combination of the rolled up sleeve of his light blue dress shirt and the tattoo that’s making her feel this way).\n\n“I also feel the same way.”\n\n“About not wanting to live with me?” There’s a sort of hopeful glint in his eye. But it’s quickly replaced with even more dread and horror.\n\n“Yes,” she stalls and it leads him to conclusions. \n\n“Because I’m a flirt and creepy and weird, right? Because I’m so sorry, I don’t know what—“\n\n“No,” she interrupts him; she’s not the type to interrupt anyone. “Not because of that, it’s because I—“\n\nHe patiently waits for her to continue.\n\nShe feels her bum sweat and her jeans get a little moist. \n\n“It’s because I also think you’re attractive, and I would also like to make it clear that I’m not a shallow person—in fact, I’m—my sister, Anna, says I’m a picky person.”\n\nIt’s his turn to turn to leave her hanging. \n\n“So please don’t think I’m some weird flirt or creepy woman trying to live with someone she wants to fu—“\n\nShe stops herself. And coughs. \n\n“What I’m trying to say is, I agree with you. About how this arrangement isn’t going to work.”\n\nReally, this is so unbecoming of her. \n\nShe swears she sees his mouth tug on an upward curve at her (fatal) mistake. \n\n~~\n\nThe next few moments come as a blur to him; it’s a combination of the unrealness of it all and the cold temperature in the room, something he doesn’t mind. \n\n“T–That’s great,” he rubs his hands against his gray cotton sweatpants. “Would you—would you like to give this—” he does the finger thing again, pointing back and forth between them. “Would you like to give us a try and go on a—” he gulps.\n\nNo woman—anyone—has ever made him this nervous before. And he’s met his fair share of pretty women and had his fair share of spontaneous, fun, nights. \n\n“Date,” he coughs up the dreadful word; and even though he doesn’t even know what he wants their relationship to be, he knows the word doesn’t do it justice. \n\nShe blinks and he swears he’s seeing stars.\n\n“I—”\n\n“You can say no, of course.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Oh that’s okay—” He stops his mouth as his brain finally catches up.\n\n“Yes, I would love to go on a date with you,” she says it, the phrase in all of its entirety and clarity; and there’s no room for any more embarrassing misunderstandings. \n\nHe allows the muscles around his lips to work properly this time and his mouth opens into a splendid—Jack-like (let it be known that he hasn’t been acting like himself this entire afternoon)—grin. \n\n~~\n\nEverything about his smile—its lopsidedness, the white of his teeth against his pale, thin lips, and the genuineness of it—does scary things to her heart. She feels the rapid, growing thump and there’s nothing she can do about it but hope that the air conditioner is louder than her beating heart. \n\n“I—” he’s still smiling, a grin so wide it becomes contagious and she finds her lips mirroring the utter happiness and joy in his. “God, this situation,” he does the pointing thing again. “Turned out better than I can ever hope for.”\n\nNow, with two smiling idiots in the room, she sheds away any lingering pride and self-consciousness and speaks up again, this time in an awful British accent. “When and where can I expect to spend said lovely evening with the great Lord Jack?”\n\nHis smile opens into a laugh, it’s a cool and mellow sort of laugh, and there’s nothing artificial or forced about it. \n\nIt’s well into the afternoon now and the sun shines more light into the room, through the balcony door, and through the thin white curtains. She sees the signs of the golden hour sunlight on the strands of his white hair and she can’t help but join in. \n\nThe sound of their laughter mingles together. She could get used to the sound, she thinks. \n\nHe brings his left hand up, makes a pondering face as he looks at his Apple watch, and responds in his (terrible) British-French accent, “Why, I do not have any other engagements later today, would the rest of this evening be a fine time for you, m’lady?”\n\nShe pretends to look deep in thought for a bit—it lasts only three seconds—before she gives him her response behind another smile, “Why that would be lovely, sir.”\n\nShe looks at him for a minute before saying, “How about right now?”\n\n“Right now? “He looks at her, a little taken aback and surprised, before looking down at his attire.\n\n~~ \n\nHe’s wearing a light blue dress shirt—it’s a little crinkly because he pulled it from his closet in a last-ditch effort to seem professional enough for what he initially thought Elsa to be. He didn’t bother to do the top-most button. Grey, baggy sweatpants wrap around his legs and he’s in his bright blue house slippers. He runs his hand through his hair. \n\nYup, a tangled, ungelled mess. \n\n“Right now,” she nods.\n\n“Like… right now right now?”\n\nHe watches her as she stands up from his sofa—and he fights back the urge to watch his couch recover from the indent her ass had made. She secures her tote bag on her left shoulder before she walks over to his side of the coffee table and extends her pale hand out to him.\n\nHer nails are painted a light, pastel blue and it has snowflakes on them.\n\n“Yup,” she pops her p—she didn’t seem like the type to pop her p. “Right now.”\n\n“Can I change?” he manages a weak laugh as he looks at her, standing right next to him.\n\nShe shakes her head, “You look fine—in fact—” She eyes him up and down and he grows the urge to cover himself. “You look good.” \n\nHe gets up from his bean bag chair and takes her hand instead. Instinctively—naturally maybe—his fingers make their way between hers and he’s holding her small hand in his. \n\nIt feels right. \n\nShe doesn’t let go. \n\n“Where to?” He’s smiling again, as he’s looking down at her; now that he’s standing up, he’s a whole head taller than her.\n\nWith his hand still in hers, she leads them to the door and there’s a spring in her steps. He finds himself mindlessly following her lead—eyes focused on nothing but their intertwined fingers. \n\nHe never wants to let go.\n\nBefore he knows it, they’re both at the door now and she’s slipping her feet into sandals.\n\nHe does nothing but just look at her.\n\n“Do you trust me, Jack? Will you follow me?” She finally says, her bright sky-blue eyes boring into his. \n\n“Anywhere.”\n\n~~\n\nAnna’s eating dinner with her dear fiance, Kristoff, when she sees it. Her phone chimes a familiar ping and she glances a few inches to the left of her rice bowl. \n\nElsa: You’re right, love at first sight is real. \n\nA few seconds later, Kristoff is overwhelmed by his wife’s squealing (screaming) and he finds himself helping her recover from having choked on the rice. \n"

{"text": "Jack lets out his worst groan of the night yet and decides to kick the bigger-than-a-pebble rock in front of him and proceeds to yelp in pain and lets out a mandatory, accompanying expletive just because he’s the type to curse at any inconvenience—but mainly—just because he can. \n\n“What the absolute fuck is wrong with you, mate,” Bunny asks as he looks back over his shoulder and gives Jack a look of pure, genuine disgust. (Or as genuine as disgust goes for best friends.) For reasons unbeknownst to Jack, Bunny also puts his arms around Tooth’s—his girlfriend's—shoulder and brings her closer to himself, and away from Jack.\n\nSoon, as all interactions between them go, Jack and Bunny spiral into a harmless(?) squabble on the busy, crowded streets of Times Square, and every other word between them is either a curse word or an insult—or both. \n\n“Guys,” Tooth’s rolling her eyes and intervening (like she usually does). “It’s Christmas for fuck’s sake, stop embarrassing us.”\n\nSandy nods and Jamie chimes in, “What’s wrong, Jack? You’re usually not this grouchy, especially not on your favorite holiday, like… ever.”\n\nJack sighs again. “It’s work.”\n\n“Isn’t the elementary school on a two-week break? What do you mean it’s work?” Tooth asks him, curious. \n\n“It’s the superintendent, Pitch.”\n\n“Him again?” Bunny asks as the group makes their way through the growing crowd in Times Square. \n\n“It’s always him.”\n\n“What did he do this time?”\n\n“Be annoying.”\n\n“...It’s Christmas, Jack,” Jamie tries this time instead of Tooth. “Don’t let it get to you. Worry and complain and be upset over it some other night. Not tonight.”\n\n“Yeah…” Jack parrots him. “Not tonight. Sorry guys.” He apologizes as he tries to keep up with them. It’s getting hard to do as the crowd grows denser though.\n\n~\n\n“And… we’re here!” Tooth exclaims excitedly as she takes in the sight in front of her. \n\nThe group is standing in front of a huge outdoor ice rink. There’s a giant (like really big) Christmas tree in the center of it all and everywhere Jack looks, people are smiling and chatting and enjoying themselves. \n\nIt really is Christmas, after all. \n\nHe kind of feels silly for letting his boss’s antics get to him. \n\n“Let’s take a photo first!” Tooth points to the photo booth a few feet away from the ticket stand as she drags Bunny along and gestures for the group to follow. \n\n“Uhm…” Jack notices it first. “What’s this?” He leans into the photo dispenser box and picks it up, inspecting it. \n\nJamie brings his face in and stares at it. “Someone must’ve forgotten to grab their photos.” \n\n“Two people, you mean,” Jack corrects him as he looks closer at the pictures.\n\nHe knows he shouldn’t and he knows this is probably a fucking invasion of privacy and that there are better ways to go about things than fucking staring down and practically burning a hole through the strip of photos. \n\nThe blonde girl’s pretty though, he thinks to himself. \n\n“Stop staring at her, bro,” Jamie gives him a look. “You’re practically drooling.”\n\n“Who’s drooling?” Bunny peaks his nosy head between them as he and Tooth finally reach them. \n\nSandy points to Jack.\n\n“What’s he lookin’ at?” Bunny asks, all the more curious as a sinister grin appears on his (annoying) face. \n\nJack prays to god Tooth stops him, but like her boyfriend, she lets the curiosity get the better of her. \n\n“She’s pretty,” she says his damn thoughts out loud. She must be a mind reader, he thinks. “I can understand why you’re staring so hard, Jack.”\n\n“Oh my gosh,” Jamie’s holding back his laughter. “Is the overworked schoolteacher finally interested in someone?” \n\nHe puts it away and stuffs the strip into his coat pocket. “Stop it guys, you know I haven’t dated—much less been interested in anyone—since high school.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” Jamie sighs. “Whatever, let’s just take the photos.”\n\n~\n\n“Elsa?” Anna stops in her tracks as she looks back at her sister who also stopped, but just a few feet behind her. “What’s wrong?” She lets out a small shiver and rubs her gloved hands together to warm herself. \n\n“We forgot to get the photos from the photobooth…” Elsa sighs and instinctively looks back to where they had just come from. \n\n“And… I don’t think we can,” she sighs dejectedly as she wraps her scarf around her tighter. The crowd’s gotten bigger and just getting back to the ice rink at the center of it all would be a challenge in itself. \n\n“Aw, that sucks,” Anna looks behind them as well. “But oh well, I guess it’s too late now. We can always take another.”\n\nElsa smiles at her sister’s optimism. “Yeah, yeah I suppose we always can.”\n\n~\n\nJack’s laughing his ass off as he watches from inside the McDonald’s as Bunny’s getting his ass handed to him by Tooth on the streets.\n\nThey were wrapping up their skating session and Bunny had thought it would be funny to sneak up on Jack and push him. Long story short, Jack survived the fall—for the most part, give or take one or two bruises that will inevitably form on his knees tomorrow. To be honest, he doesn’t really mind, because someone once told him that bruises are a reminder that you’re alive, because don’t form on corpses. Or something. \n\nBut he will never tell Bunny—or Tooth—that fact, because if he did, then he wouldn’t be enjoying his front-row seats to the shit show just beyond the see-through McDonald’s wall. This is an all-time low for Bunny that Jack swears he will never not remind him of. \n\nHe’s laughing but because he’s enjoying the scene a little too much, too hard, he doesn’t notice Sandy getting up from his seat before it’s too late. \n\n“Aw, man I should’ve stopped him.”\n\n“You’re really enjoying this, aren’t you, Jack?” Jamie looks over at him, amused. \n\n“Yeah,” he snickers. “Aren’t you?”\n\nJamie laughs as Jack looks elsewhere. That’s when he sees her.\n\nIt’s a damn motherfucking Christmas miracle. \n\n“I’ll be right back.”\n\nJamie still isn’t rid of his laughter. “What?”\n\n\nJack’s working furiously to button up his coat and he picks up his keys and phone from the booth he was just sitting at. “I’ll be right back, tell the rest of the gang I’ll be right back.”\n\n“Jack?” Jamie’s confused.\n\nBut before he can ask Jack what’s really happening, he’s already out the door.\n\n~\n\n“Hey!”\n\n“Do you hear that, Anna?” Elsa stops in her tracks. “Someone’s shouting something.” \n\n“Crazy people, am I right?” Anna laughs it off as she tugs at Elsa’s hand. “Come on, we’re going to miss the crosslight.” \n\n~\n\n“Hey!” Jack’s trying and trying his best to get their attention amongst the crowd. He’s aware, of how crazy this is and how crazy he must look. The worst part is, he doesn’t even know their names to make it any less harder for him. “The blonde and strawberry blonde girls!”\n\nThis is the fucking worst, he thinks to himself. Because really, how fucking crazy does he seem right now? \n\nHe’s already getting looks and side-eyes. \n\n~\n\n“I think that man is talking about us, Anna,” Elsa still doesn’t budge from her place on the sidewalk.\n\nAnna’s already halfway across the street, “Come on Elsa!” She shouts back. “Before it’s too late!”\n\n“Cross without me!” Elsa’s waving and shouting back now. “I’ll see you on the other side!” \n\nAnna looks hesitant but at her sister’s wave and smile, she obliges. \n\n~\n\n“Hey,” Jack finally catches up to the girl. “I know I must seem like a fucking lunatic right now, but thanks for waiting.” His heart’s beating and he tells himself it’s because of his lack of breath but his mind knows it’s also because of the (awfully pretty, gorgeous, beautiful) girl in front of him. \n\nThere’s one thought in his mind right now: the photobooth picture did not do her justice. \n\nHe swallows his saliva to calm his beating heart. \n\nShe laughs.\n\nHe’s going to lose it. \n\n“It’s good to be self-aware at least. It tells me you’re not a creepy guy.”\n\nEven her fucking voice is pretty. \n\n“Here, I found your photos at the photo booth a little while ago” he explains himself first before he awkwardly reaches into his pockets and searches for the strip. (Because—even though he may be an idiot—even he knows how creepy it would be if he reached into his pockets before saying even a single word to the pretty lady in front of him. If he did that, then he’d actually freak her out). \n\nHe hands it to her. “Sorry, it’s a bit wrinkly though—because really—what are the chances I’d actually find you tonight?”\n\nHer eyes light up, “Oh my gosh, thank you so much, you have no idea how much I regretted forgetting to pick it up.”\n\n\n~\n\n“You’re welcome.”\n\nThe tall (cute) guy in front of her grins and tilts his head to the side a little. This does scary things to her heart. \n\nThe cross signal comes back up again but she still doesn’t move from her place on the street. People are passing them and she’s very aware of the situation they’re both in, but she isn’t quite ready to let this stranger go yet. “Really, thank you so much, do you mind if my sister—the other woman in this photo—and I treat you to some coffee or something?”\n\nThe man’s eyes light up at her offer, “You’re not going to kill me?” He jokes.\n\n“Nope, not at least until after you’re fed,” she smirks. \n\n“I’ll take you up on that offer, Miss…”\n\n“Elsa.” It’s not like her, she thinks. To offer a man her name in the first five minutes of meeting him—much less two. “Just call me Elsa.”\n\n“Nice to meet you, Elsa.” He gives her one of those damn grins again. “I’m Jack.”\n\n~\n\n“Elsa!” The strawberry blonde—her sister, if his memory serves him right—runs up to the pair. She’s a little out of breath and every time she breathes, Jack sees clouds escape her mouth. “I was waiting for you but you never came. So I ran back here instead.” \n\n“Oh—” Elsa realizes her mistake. “I’m so sorry Anna, I was caught up with someone.” She gestures to Jack. “This is Jack.”\n\n“I’m Anna,” Anna whistles and gives Elsa a look. A look Jack notices but Elsa ignores. \n\n“He’s the gentleman who was calling to us earlier—so he can return this,” she shows Anna the strip of photos. \n\nAnna’s face lights up as she laughs, “Good to know he’s not some creepy stalker dude.”\n\nJack feigns offense, “I tried my best, okay? It’s hard when you’re working without names.”\n\n“Anyways, as I was saying, I told him we’d invite him for coffee,” Elsa brings back her offer from earlier. \n\n“Sure,” Anna smiles. Jack notices a weird hint of something in her eyes but because he doesn’t know her well enough, he doesn’t assume and doesn’t question her intentions. “How about tonight?”\n\nElsa blinks.\n\n“Tonight?” The both of them say in unison. \n\nAnna bursts out laughing again. “Yeah, I’m down for tonight, are you guys? I’ll ask Kristoff to come as well, do you two mind?”\n\nElsa looks hesitant, “I don’t really have any more plans tonight, but I’m unsure about Jack…”\n\nHe really, really really really wants to say yes, because really, how often is it that an extremely pretty girl asks you out for coffee? (Well, he guesses it was more of Anna that made it happen tonight, but Elsa was the one who offered).\n\nBut he also isn’t the type to flake on his friends… \n\n“There he is, Jack!” a familiar voice calls out to him. Speak of the devils.\n\n“Jack!” Tooth calls out to him this time. “Why did you run off on us without saying anything?”\n\n~\n\nElsa looks from Jack to the woman who came up to him. She’s a whole foot shorter than him but she can tell Jack looks up to this person—she sees it in the way he brings his hands to the nape of his neck, softens his voice, and apologizes to her. \n\nShe doesn’t notice the rest of the group until another one of them says something. “So that’s the situation, eh?”\n\n“Hey!” Anna breaks the silence between the two groups. “I’m Anna, and this is my sister Elsa. I take it you guys are Jack’s friends?”\n\n“Yup!” a brunette boy extends his hand out to Anna. “I’m Jamie, this is Sandy, Aster, and Tiana. You two are the ones in the photos right?”\n\n“Yup!” Anna pops her p. Elsa knows she’s excited about meeting new people. “It’s great to meet you guys, thank you so much for taking care of our photos and returning it.”\n\nUnfortunately, Elsa feels a little differently about meeting new people though. It’s not because she’s scared or anything, but because she’s more or less been an introvert her entire life. And honestly, this is just too much stimulation and faces and names, too much too soon.\n\n“Did Jack scare you guys?” the woman in the group, Tiana, asks.\n\n“Who are ye kidding, this is Jack, of course, he scared them,” Aster says in his heavy Australian accent. \n\nAnna laughs again, “You wouldn’t believe it, but imagine an unknown man pushing and running through a crowd shouting ‘hey!’ at you.”\n\n“Of course he did that,” Jamie gives him a look of ‘are you an idiot’ and Sandy laughs.\n\n“I told you I tried my best with the information I had,” Jack whines. “This is what I get for helping strangers.”\n\n“Well, since everyone’s here…” Elsa doesn’t know where this confidence is coming from. “As thanks, why don’t my sister and I treat you guys to drinks or something?” \n\n~ \n\n“They’re nice lads, aren’t they?” Bunny says after the sisters left with a man named Kristoff, who they had learned, was Anna’s fiance of two months. (They were also invited to their wedding in March). \n\nJack huffs out a cloud and buries his face further into his scarf. It’s almost midnight now and the both of them are standing outside a Starbucks, waiting for the rest of their group to finish using the restroom or washing their hands or asking for the cute barista’s number or whatever. \n\nIt’s getting a bit chilly but Jack doesn’t mind. \n\n“Yeah,” he hums in agreement as the night’s events are catching up to him. Right now, he wants nothing more than to take a nice, cold, shower, climb in his bed, and nap for the rest of winter break. “They’re quite a bunch, alright.”\n\nBunny laughs before he slaps Jack in the face with his words, “You like her—Elsa—don’t you?”\n\n“What!” Jack guffaws and whiplashes his face towards Bunny’s. He gets a few looks from the people walking by. “Don’t be absurd, I’m not some horny teenager.”\n\n“She’s really pretty though, I would go for it if I were you.”\n\n“Listen to yourself man,” Jack rolls his eyes and teases Bunny because he doesn’t want his (lack of a) love life to be the topic of conversation. “What would Tooth say?”\n\n“Our relationship is mature enough that me giving one of my best lads my honest opinion on a girl wouldn’t ruin it,” Bunny smirks, like the damn professional mature know-it-all tech-bro he is. “I’m just giving you a little push of encouragement, Jack. That’s all.”\n\nJack sighs out another cloud of air. “I wasn’t even brave enough to ask her for her number.”\n\n“You can always ask Tooth.”\n\n“Ask me what?” Tooth pokes her head between both of her friends as Jamie and Sandy follow right behind her. She beckons to Bunny. \n\n“Jack has something he wants to ask you,” Bunny answers for the both of them as he hands Tooth his cup of matcha which she happily takes as she gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.\n\nEven though Jack has been around them since high school—since they started dating—he groans, “Can you guys not do that in front of us single people? It’s honestly kind of depressing.” \n\nThe both of them laugh, “Just find someone, Jack.” Bunny raises his eyebrows and gives him a knowing look. \n\nThe group is walking to their apartment now—Jack, Sandy, and Jamie are roommates, and Bunny and Tooth live just two floors above them. (Jack’s surprised they’re all still this close and their friend group is still functioning despite more or less living together for years now. However, with a psychiatrist in the group, problems were resolved rather quickly). \n\n“So what did you want to ask Tooth?” Jamie asks during their walk. \n\nBunny shoots him a look. Jack knows that if he doesn’t ask Tooth about it, then Bunny will ask for him.\n\nThat’s the last thing he wants. \n\n“Oh, uhm…” He’s so fucking embarrassed right now, but one more look at Bunny and he caves. “I was wondering if you can give me Elsa’s number.”\n\nTooth lets out an ‘oh’ sound and Bunny’s chuckles while looking at him and Jamie’s fucking laughing his ass off and Sandy’s trying his best to calm Jamie down, but Jack can tell it’s taking the psychiatrist his entire fucking willpower to stop himself from laughing as well. He sees it in the small quirk of his lips and the clench in his hands. \n\n“Come on guys,” he gives his best friends a look. “I’m trying my best, okay?”\n\n“What happened to Jackson ‘Frost’ Overland being single for the rest of his life?” Jamie asks between laughter. \n\n“That’s if she even likes me that away,” Jack corrects him as he rolls his eyes. “So about her number, Tooth…”\n\n“Sure,” she brings out her phone. “Here.” She shows him Elsa’s contact page. \n\nHe notices the accompanying name first. \n\nHe squints. “Why the hell is her saved name, Elsa, Jack’s gee-eff.” \n\n“Oh my fucking god, no way you didn’t, babe.” Bunny’s laughing his ass off now, Sandy finally loses his composure, and Jamie’s laughing as hard as ever. \n\nThe group’s getting looks from everyone who walks by them now, but none of them seem to care. \n\n“That’s so fucking creepy, Tooth, what would she think if she sees that?!” Jack’s fighting the embarrassment. \n\nTooth shrugs and smiles, “You never know.”\n\n“Guys!” Jack complains and groans and whines, and even though it’s past midnight in the middle of winter on Christmas Eve (Christmas Day now, really), he feels his entire face (and ears) burning up. “Come on, is my misery really that funny?”\n\n~\n\nIt’s 12:54 AM. \n\nThat’s when Elsa gets a text from a number she doesn’t recognize. She’s just finished drying her hair when she sees it. \n\nUnknown: hey.\n\nA few seconds later, another text follows. \n\nThis is Jack. \n\nShe giggles to herself as she types her response. \n\nYou know you have a habit of making your first impressions borderline creepy.\n\nThen, hey Jack.\n\n~\n\n“Elsaaa!” Anna knocks on her sister’s door. “Wake up, it’s Christmas, it’s Christmas!” \n\nAnna doesn’t give Elsa time to get up from her bed to open the door—or even to open her eyes awake—before she opens the door and steps in. \n\n“It’s fucking Christmas, Elsa!” Anna says in her singsong voice, a clear sign she’s excited. “Any plans for today?”\n\nElsa groans as she brings the blanket up over her face when Anna presses the button against the wall, bringing up the blinds. “What time is it?”\n\n“Two,” Anna tells her. \n\nThis wakes Elsa up. “What?! That has to be a mistake, right? No way it’s past noon.”\n\nAnna sighs, “Believe it or not sis, it’s two alright. It’s not like you to stay in bed for so long, what were you doing last night?”\n\nElsa blushes a little but unfortunately, her little sister has always had a sixth sense for things like this.\n\n“Or rather, who were you doing last night?”\n\nElsa gives her sister a look, “Come on, Anna. It’s not like that, I was just—” She considers keeping it from Anna. \n\n“You were texting Jack, right?”\n\n“What?” Elsa sucks at acting and pretending and lying, especially to her younger sister, but she still tries anyway. Because there is no way Anna’s first fucking guess is right on the mark.\n\nThere’s just no way, Elsa thinks to herself as she continues to deny it, “What makes you so sure?”\n\n“So you were texting, Jack.” Anna smiles a smug smile. “I know you well, really well. I grew up with you, Elsa.” She then giggles like she’s back in high school. \n\nShe’s already imagining the entirety of Elsa’s future with Jack. \n\n“I was just getting to know him better,” Elsa makes an excuse for herself. “Considering we invited his whole friend group to your wedding—may I remind you we’ve known them for less than twenty-four hours?”\nAnna gives her sister a quizzical, doubtful look, “They’re a nice bunch so sure you were, Elsa. I totally believe you when you say you’re scouting the strangers or whatever.” \n\nElsa sighs and gets out of bed. She slips her feet into her slippers and admits defeat, she never got away with lying to Anna about her love life to begin with, so why try now? “Yeah, I was texting Jack.”\n\n“You’re attracted to him, aren’t you,” Anna pursues. “Because goddamn is that man good-looking. He’s like… the only person in the world who looks well with hair as white as his.”\n\nElsa sighs, “No?”\n\n“Elsa.”\n\n“Fine, yeah,” she sighs. “I guess he’s a little bit my type.”\n\nAnna laughs, “I didn’t even know you have a type.”\n\n~ \n\n“What are you bringing to the party, tonight?” Jamie asks Jack as he zips up his coat. “And can I put my name on it?”\n\nJack’s lounging on their couch, watching TV because he has nothing better to do on Christmas Day—at least not until tonight anyway. \n\n“Nachos and chips,” he responds but doesn’t look away from his phone. “Probably, I don’t know, something cheap though.”\n\n“Cool.” Jack hears the jingling of keys against phone. “I’ll split it with you then.”\n\n“Sure,” Jack hums.\n\n“Not gonna wish me luck for my date?”\n\n“You’re going on a date?” Jack’s eyes finally leave his phone and he’s looking at Jamie, eyes so wide and blue they look like they’re going to pop out out of his sockets.\n\n“If you were half-listening last night, you would’ve known, I told Sandy this bro.”\n\n\nJack pouts, “Hey, I was just tired, that’s all.”\n\n“No,” Jamie denies this and calls him out for his bullshit. “You think I’m an idiot, don’t you Jack? You were texting Elsa, everyone and their mothers know this.”\nJack gasps, “You know me too well, Jams.”\n\n“You’ve got no plans today, right? Just ask her out and invite her to the party tonight or something,” Jamie suggests. “That’s what I’m trying to do with my date today.”\n\n“I’ll think about it,” Jack looks back at his phone. “Good luck on your date.”\n\n“Thanks,” Jamie smiles. “I better see Elsa tonight though, and maybe Anna and Kristoff.”\n\n~\n\nDing. \n\nElsa was never the type to jump at any notifications. She knows how detrimental the chime is to the human brain, but she can’t—and doesn’t—help it this time. She looks looks at her phone.\n\nAnna notices this development with her sister and looks over at Elsa from her place on the couch. “What’d Jack say?”\n\n“You know, it’s him?”\n\n“How can I not.” Anna rolls her eyes as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “You barely text. Let alone, barely addicted to your phone.”\n\n“He’s inviting me out for dinner this afternoon…” Elsa starts. “And the three of us to a party tonight.”\n\n\nAnna’s eyes widen in excitement. “No way a party?” Then her face falls. “Unfortunately, Kristoff and I have plans tonight, but you should definitely go.”\n\n“You think so?” Elsa looks thoughtful. “Isn’t this development a little too fast?”\n\n“Come on, Elsa. Jack’s a nice cute guy, what’s there to lose?”\n\n“My life.”\n\n“Quit it with your humor,” Anna says as she gets up and stretches. “Come, let’s pick out your outfit.”’\n\nElsa sighs, types something into her phone, and press sends,\n\n~ \n\nI’ll pick you u up in front of ur building @ ~4 pm\nJack presses send and rings the doorbell in front of him. \n\n“Jack?” Tooth opens the door and eyes him up and down. He’s in his pajamas: a white, sweater with a giant penguin on it, and black, fuzzy sweatpants with reindeer faces all over them. His dogs are out. “Put some shoes on, Jack.”\n\n“Is that Jack?” He hears Bunny’s familiar, loud voice somewhere inside. \n\n“Yes, please let me in!” He pleads. “I really need your help.”\n\n“Come in,” Tooth scootches over to the side, opens the door wider and lets him in. \n\n“Is Sandy with you?” Bunny asks as Jack beelines to their sofa. For some reason, it’s a lot more comfortable than the couch in his apartment. (A lot cleaner too.) \n\n“No, I think he’s running errands with Hiccup for tonight’s party—say did you know about Jamie’s date today?”\n\nBunny rolls his eyes, “You’re the only one who doesn’t know about it, mate. Too busy talkin’ to Elsa huh?”\n\nTooth laughs and Jack grumbles, “Hey, I was tired too man.”\n\n“So what’s up Jack?” she asks him.\n\n“I need your help with my date in like… half an hour.”\n\nBunny jokes on the tea he’s drinking and Tooth scolds him. “Half an hour, that’ so soon! Why are you only telling us this now?”\n\n“Cause I just asked her like twenty minutes ago,” he laughs, but then he realizes the severity of the situation he’s in and flips like a switch. “I have no idea what to wear, I haven’t been on a date in so long. Please help me guys.”\n\nBunny lets out a huge sigh as Tooth giggles. “What am I going to do with you, Jack? How’s your closet situation looking?” \n\n“You know what I wear, you see me almost every day.”\n\nTooth chimes in, “I think it’s best if you lend him something for tonight, Bunny.”\n\n“Yeah, I think you’re right,” Bunny agrees. He gets up and starts to walk down the hall, “Follow me, Jack. And listen here—if you spill anything on any of my clothes, you will have to replace it.”\n\n“Oh come on Bunny, do you know the difference between our income?”\n\n~\n\n“Elsa, hi!” \n\nShe turns to the direction of the sound. Her heart swells when she sees him. \n\n“For you, m’lady,” he grins and bows and hands her a bouquet of flowers. \n\n“Oh, Jack,” she smiles and takes the bundle in her hands. “You shouldn’t have, Jackson.” \n\n~\n\nThe date—oh please, can he even call this a date, he really hopes it’s a date, but what if she thinks it’s something else—goes well. \n\nNow, the both of them are in the elevator, making their way up to the penthouse floor of his building. \n\n“Wow,” Elsa says casually. “The penthouse.’’\n\nJack smirks. “Yup, North—the host of the party—is pretty rich.”\n\n“Pretty is an understatement.”\n\n“I should’ve said this sooner, but—” Jack figures he should tell her before there’s no more privacy for them. “You look really pretty today.”\n\n“Are you saying I’m not pretty other times?”\n\nJack’s eyes widen and he’s working to fix his mistake. Elsa laughs and he blushes. \n\nShe’s teasing him. This woman is fucking teasing him. \n\n“You’re fucking gorgeous all the time, Elsa.” \n\nAnd where the fuck is this confidence coming from. It must’ve been Christmas—it’s his favorite holiday after all.\n\nIt’s Elsa’s turn to flush a bright red now. \n\nJack laughs and Elsa hides her face in her hair. \n\n“Don’t tease me like that.”\n\n“Sorry,” he apologizes. “But I really do mean it though.”\n\n“Thanks… Jack,” she finds her composure a little while later. “You too, you look really good, especially tonight.”\n\nDing. \n\nJack thanks the elevator. Because if it didn’t chime, then he would’ve done something he might regret. \n\nElsa looked really pretty under the golden light, with her face in her hair, and a blushing mess. \n\n~\n\n“Frost is here!”\n\nAs Elsa enters with Jack, someone already notices them. \n\nA whistle, “Who’s the pretty lady Jack?” Another voice asks and Jack puts his arm over her shoulders. \n\n“Back off, Hans,” Jack shoos the guy away. “She’s my date tonight.”\n\nRight when he said that, she feels his grip around her shoulder tighten. He brings his face closer to her so she can hear him amongst the crowd. “I’m so sorry if I assume this is a date, if you’re not comfortable with labeling it as one, please let me know.”\n\nWith his face just a mere inches away from hers, she kind of wants to kiss him. But she laughs and quirks her eyebrows instead, “Of course it’s a date, dummy.”\n\n~\n\nJack sighs a sigh of relief. It feels as if a semi-huge weight has been lifted off his shoulders. \n\n“Jack!” Jamie waves at him. “Elsa! Over here,” He motions for the pair to come over. \n\nWhen they get into talking distance, Bunny tosses Jack a sweater. “Here ya go, mate. Your ugly Christmas sweater.”\n\nElsa looks amused as she watches Jack put it over his polo. \n\n“It’s our friend group’s tradition,” Tooth explains to her. “Every Christmas, no matter what we’re doing, we always wear ugly Christmas sweaters when we’re together.”\n\nThen she offers one to Elsa, “Would you like to join us?”\n\n“Oh no, I possibly couldn’t intrude on your guys’s tradition.”\n\nTooth smiles, “Oh it’s okay, who knows, soon we might even be seeing you around more often.”\n\nJack fucking chokes on his drink. Jamie laughs. Bunny looks at Tooth proudly. Sandy smiles. \n\nElsa  fucking blushes. \n\n~ \n\n“I’m—I’m not quite sure what you mean, Tooth.”\n\n“Oh don’t pay me any mind, Elsa,” she keeps her smile. “It would make me happy if you join us in this tradition though.”\n\nElsa smiles and folds, “Well if you insist.” \n\nJack watches her as she takes off her coat and wiggles into the sweater. And even though she’s wearing something pretty modest underneath, Jack wants nothing more than to hide her from all the staring eyes. (He’s just selfish like that.) \n\nSandy raises his cup and Jamie joins in and shouts, “It’s fucking party time!”\n\nJack holds Elsa close and laughs, “Merry Christmas you motherfuckers.”\n\nElsa giggles in his embrace.\n\n~ \n\n“Thanks for the night, Jack,” she smiles as she thanks him. “I had a lot of fun.”\n\nThey’re in front of her apartment door now, in the lit lobby, it’s nearing two am. He hears a distant elevator chime.\n\n“Anytime, Elsa,” Jack smiles at her. \n\n“Would you like to…” \n\n“Hm?”\n“Hang out again sometimes?”\n\n“As in…” he gulps. “Go on dates?”\n\nShe smiles, “Yeah. I’d like to go on more dates with you, Jack.”\n\nIs she implying something? She has to be implying something right? There’s just no way she can say this and not imply something. \n\n“Elsa, I…” he coughs and chokes on his next words but he’s beyond the point of turning back. It’s almost two am, Christmas was just two hours ago, so if he doesn’t do it now, then he doubts he would ever get the chance—courage—to again. \n\n“Would you like to….”\n\nIs this too soon to ask her to date me? \n\n“Would you like to go out with, Jack?” \n\nHe blinks. \n\nWhat. \n\n“How—” \n\nHe sees a faint of worry in her pretty blue eyes.\n\n“How did you know what I was going to ask?”\n\nA pause, and then a beautiful laugh escapes her lips. \n\n“Is that a yes?”\n\nHe joins her and laughs at their situation. His hands reach out for her and pull her slender body closer—into—his. “Of course, I’d be an idiot not to,” he grins and leans in and kisses her. \n\n“Okay…” a familiar, singsong voice. “I knew I heard voices beyond the door.”\n\n“Anna!” Elsa’s a blushing mess and Jack laughs awkwardly because that’s what he always does when he doesn’t know what the fuck else to do.\n\nAnna grins. “Merry Christmas, you too.”\n"

{"text": "“Anna, are you sure you two aren’t moving too fast?” \n\n“What? No, Elsa! I’m one-hundred percent sure we’re not,” Anna responded through the video call as she threw her hands up the air in exasperation, a gesture Elsa was used to seeing from her younger sister. \n\nElsa heaved a long and loud sigh—the sigh to end all sighs—and surrendered herself, “I’m just worried about you, that’s all, and—”\n\nAnd saying that was a mistake because even through her laptop screen, Elsa noticed how Anna’s shoulders stiffened, “Is this about what happened in the past? With Sideburns?”\n\nNow, it was Elsa’s shoulders that stiffened; she nearly amputated her thumb chopping tomatoes. “No?”\n\nShe hadn’t meant for her answer to come off as questioningly as it did—but it ended up being so anyway.\n\nIt was Anna’s turn to sigh now, “Do you not trust me, Elsa?”\n\nShit. \n\nAnd now, Elsa was left to recover from what was to come next, “Anna—you know I didn’t mean it that way. It’s just—”\n\nAnna sighed again, “I know, I know, you’re worried about me. But Elsa, I’m 20 now.”\n\nElsa bit the inside of her mouth, “I know, I know.”\n\n“I’m no longer the college freshmen I once was, Els. I’m older and wiser.”\n\nElsa smiled at Anna’s attempt at reassuring her; a good one, but an attempt nonetheless. A smile found its way to her lips, “You know you were a freshman just 2 years ago, right?”\n\nThe way Anna rolled her eyes at the remark didn’t go unnoticed by Elsa. “Thanks for the concern, but Kris—”\n\nBeep. \n\nThe singular beep was followed by a louder one and then—\n\nAnd then the lights to her apartment went out, along with her sister’s face on her laptop screen. \n\nElsa blinked once; then twice. It took her longer than it really should’ve to comprehend what had happened to figure out that it was a blackout.\n\nSquinting her eyes a few times to adjust to what light was remaining inside of her Manhattan apartment, she felt around the kitchen counter for her phone; her conversation with Anna was not going to be put on hold just because some fool had one too many things running—but to be honest—she could care less about the cause of the blackout. \n\nEventually, she grabbed hold of the familiar device and picked it up; however, the screen wasn’t turning on. \n\nLosing nothing but just a little bit of patience—and hope—she pressed firmly on the power button. After a few (awfully long) seconds, her screen flashed a light flash, and the dreaded picture of a battery with a sliver of flashing red appeared.\n\n“Shit,” an expletive finally escaped her mind.\n\nLetting out yet another exasperated sigh, she felt around her tables again for her keys this time.\n\nAnd Elsa went out her door. \n\n—--\n\n“He’s mid mate what the fuck, why is he mid?” \n\n“I’m coming Bunny,” a soft voice replied. \n\n“Tooth!” Jack called after her over their Discord call. “I can’t just lane by my—shit the jungler’s here—their jungler’s here! Tooth! Come back please.”\n\n“But I’m already halfway through the river, Jack…”\n\n“I swear to god mate,” Bunny started. \n\nJack could hear some form of snort through his headset, which—he could only guess—was from the man, the legend, the mid-laner himself: Bunny.\n\n“Now you know how I felt when your fucking supp—”\n\nBeep. \n\nThe singular beep was followed by a louder one and then—\n\nAnd then Jack was sitting in front of his now turned-off monitor, basking in the newfound darkness of his apartment. \n\n“Shit,” he murmured to himself as he looked for his phone—he swore to god it was somewhere on his desk—at least he hoped it was. \n\nLuckily, he was able to find the device sooner than he anticipated—it was thanks to the onslaught of the familiar ring of discord notifications from his friends, whom he was just playing with before his world was engulfed in black; the clearest sign of a blackout. \n\nBunz: Where the fuck did you go?\n\naToothz: @Frost ???\n\nJ-me: Actually inting us for real, huh????\n\n“There’s a blackout in my apartment building,” he mumbled his response to the group out loud.\n\n“Good luck winning the 4v5 without me bozos,” he smirked at a remark well made—he could tell Bunny was fuming right now. He could just imagine the lad’s feet tapping viciously—a habit he could never not remind Bunny of. \n\nHe proceeded to rid his hand of his phone, took off his headset, got up from his chair, and walked towards his window; a full-wall window that opened up the beautiful city of Manhattan to him.\n\nHe pulled up the blinds.\n\nHis face grimaced at the sight: one of the liveliest and bustling cities of the night was no longer lively. It was probably still bustling—but he couldn’t tell—because, as his apartment, the city was too, blanketed in darkness; in an almost eery pitch-black.\n\nThe young adult traveled back to his desk and reached for his phone, intending to tell his friends—\n\nRing. \n\nBut he guessed answering the door could come first.\n\n—-\n\nRing. \n\nElsa stepped back and looked up at the door across from hers nervously. She stood in the empty hallway, both palms intertwined, fingers feeling each other, tapping her left foot for the sake of having something to focus on, and lightly biting her lips. \n\nWas her neighbor-from-across-the-hall’s door always this big and domineering? Or was it just the lack of light that made it seem so? Or was it because this was—will be—the first time she will actually converse with him? \n\nObviously, she’s seen him around—sometimes. And looking back, she did (technically) talk to him once. Of course, he approached her first and all—offering her a plate of cookies because he had just moved in and that was, quite frankly, the friendly neighborhood thing to do. \n\nThen why the hell was she so nervous now? He wasn’t weird or anything. \n\nShe bit her lips again; she figured it must’ve been the lack of light. \n\nDamn this blackout. \n\n“Damn this blackout indeed.”\n\nHer eyes widened and she whipped her head up and away from the oh-so-interesting floor.\n\nDid I say that out loud?\n\nThe man standing under the threshold blinked, then laughed a light laugh, “You did, indeed, say that out loud,” He paused. “You were thinking out loud twice, actually.”\n\nShe bit her lips again and leveled her gaze; she figured she didn’t need to pursue any more eye contact. Their height difference and darkness made it hard—too hard—to do so anyway.\n\nIt totally wasn’t the embarrassment—nope—it would take her more than some uncontrollable form of emotion to meddle with her professionalism. \n\nWell, it’s actually a lack of professionalism now.\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\nAnd I should stop talking out loud.\n\nHe laughed a louder laugh this time, “You really should.” And then he chose to save her from any more slip-ups, “Elsa, right? Did you need anything?”\n\nAnd if her cheeks ever did turn a slight shade of pink, then she thanked the blackout for rendering it nearly impossible for the man before her to see so. \n\n“Yes, actually,” she extended a slim hand out to him.\n\nHe blinked.\n\n“Y’know, the one from across the hall,” she coughed. “Quite literally, from across the hall.”\n\nThe man laughed again. \n\nHoly shit, does this dude laugh at everything? \n\n“I’m Jack,” his hand reached for hers. “Jackson,” she felt his fingertips on her hand. “Jackson Overland,” his fingers morphed around her palm. “But no one really calls me that unless you’re my angry mother or someone who works for the government,” and he shook her hand.\n\n“I know.“\n\nHe smiled, still holding onto her hand, “I’m glad you remembered.”\n\n“Anyways,” he relaxed and pulled away. “Did you need something, Elsa?”\n\n“Actually, I was wondering if—” and she was starting to think this may have been more trouble than it was worth. But she was already halfway through with the plan. “If you had a spare portable charger or something—one that doesn’t need charging by the way—like—”\n\nHe laughed again. “Don’t worry about it, I know what you mean.”\n\nHe turned a little away from the door, “You wanted to see if you can borrow a portable charger with juice left in it, right?”\n\n“Y—Yes, please.” \n\n“I have one but I’ll just have to see if it’s functional,” he stepped away from the door. “Be right back.”\n\nElsa nodded and muffled a quick ‘thank you’ before he completely left her sight.\n\n—\n\nJack dug around his belongings and drawers looking for the portable charger he was tasked to find. \n\nEventually—after what took 2 minutes but felt more like an eternity because he kept someone waiting—he found it. Bringing his phone out of his pocket, he plugged the wire in. \n\nNothing. \n\nHis face fell and he tried again.\n\nUnplug. Plug. Unplug. Plug. Unplug the wire. Move it to the other side of the device. Plug.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nFinally accepting that the portable doesn’t have any more juice in it—or maybe it was just broken, who the hell knows, he hadn’t used this thing in a long time—he made his way back to the door.\n\nHe didn’t want to keep his very attractive—stop it—neighbor waiting any longer.\n\n“Els—”\n\nThe girl looked up from the floor.\n\nHe nervously looked at her hopeful expression, afraid to be the reason it doesn’t last, “Um…” the next few words stopped midway through his throat.\n\n“I’m sorry to disappoint but,” he scratched the nape of his neck, a sure-fire sign of nervousness, and held the device in his hand up for her to see. “This thing doesn’t work anymore.”\n\nHe didn’t miss the glint of disappointment in her eyes—even without the aid of lights. \n\nThe faintest curve of a line traced her lips, “That’s alright.” \n\nHe wanted to say something more. \n\n“Sorry for the trouble,” she didn’t let him continue. “I’ll be taking my leave no—”\n\n“Wait!” \n\nShe halted mid-turn and looked back at him, newly painted confusion and expectancy splattered her face. \n\nHe gulped and relived the all too familiar tense in his muscles and felt heat rush to his cheeks. \n\n“Yes…” she looked back up at him, hopeful. “Jack?”\n\n“Um—“ he coughed and cleared his throat, unsure of what to say next.\n\nBut right as he opened his mouth again, his stomach decided to do the talking for him.\n\nGrowl. \n\nShe jerked in surprise at the sudden sound and immediately looked down—it wasn’t at the floor this time though—(to Jack’s dismay).\n\nAlmost as quickly, he followed her line of sight as a new wave of heat rushed to his cheeks; this time, because of another reason—a reason Jack doesn’t want to think about. Ever. \n\n“Aheh…” a lame chuckle escaped his slightly quivering lips.\n\nAny slim chance he thought he had with her was long gone now. He wanted to shit his pants of embarrassment. \n\nShe looked back up at him—and holy fuck is that a teasing look in her eyes? Stop it Jack—“I’m guessing you didn’t have dinner yet?”\n\nHe laughed again, this time, more so to save himself the little face he had left. “Ding! You guessed right.”\n\nHe scurried to close the door almost right after, “Super sorry about that Elsa, I’ll lea—excuse myself now—y’know— to feed my sorry as—self—“\n\n“Wait!” Her hand reached out to stop him.\n\nIt was tugging at his shirt. \n\nHoly fucking shit she’s—\n\n—\n\nI’m tugging his shirt. \n\nImmediately, the once regal lady tucked her hand back to where it belonged: at her side. \n\nShe scrambled to apologize almost right after, “I—I’m so sorry about that. Holy sh—I didn’t mean to be so rude.”\n\n“It’s fine,” Jack smiled a reassuring smile. “So was there something else you needed?”\n\n“Ac—“ Elsa looked down at the ground again and tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear. “Actually, I was wondering if you wanted to eat dinner with me—you see—I always tend to cook more than enough for one so—“\n\nAnd then she looked up, “But it’s fine if you already had something in the oven or something—“ she stopped and seemed to reconsider something. “Actually—“\n\n—\n\n“Forget I as—“ \n\nJack smiled a beaming smile and interrupted her before she retracted her offer, “Hell yeah, Elsa. I would love to.” \n\nGood job, this stomach of mine.\n\n“Really?”\n\n—\n\n“Really.” \n\nShe couldn’t see herself, but she was sure Jack’s smile was mirrored on her face. “T—That’s fantastic, Jack! Would you like to go to my place? Or yours? Either way, I don’t think it’ll make that much a difference—y’know—city-wide blackout and all.”\n\nJack thought about it for a while before he suggested another place that crossed his mind, “Actually, how do you feel about our building's rooftop?”\n\nShe looked thoughtful.\n\n“But if you don’t want to, that’s tota—“\n\n“No Jack, I think that’s a great idea,” she was still smiling. “It’s about time we utilize the things our building offers in the rent contract. Five thousand dollars a month is far from cheap—even for a skyscraper building in Manhattan.”\n\nJack laughed at her (attempted) joke, “You’re right. It’s about time I go outside today. My friend, Bunny would be proud.”\n\n“Alright,” she smiled again as she looked down at her watch. “It’s almost eight-thirty now but—but we’ll be fine.\n\n—\n\nJack smiled again. He knew they would be.\n\n“I’ll meet you back here in fifteen minutes? There are some last-minute things that need to be done,” She was counting the many things to do on her fingers now, mumbling some sort of mumbo-jumbo, Jack couldn’t guess.\n\nCute. \n\n“Awesome,” Jack should really fucking stop smiling. “I’ll take care of the blanket and other things we might need—like flashlights—I would totally bring candles but I think there’s a light gust of wind outside. Accidents in the dark are the worst.”\n\n“That would be great!” She beamed at the idea of a picnic on the rooftop and Jack couldn’t help but notice the way her loose braid followed her movements—so subtle and perfe—it perfectly suited her. \n\n“I’ll bring the utensils and food.”\n\nJack nodded and—\n\nAnd he fucking smiled again. How many times was that now? Holy fucking hell she’s going to think he’s a psycho or something. \n\nIt took every ounce of his present willpower to not ruffle his hair in nervousness. \n\n“Yes ma’am!” He responded diligently instead. \n\nElsa was at the front of her door now, subtly unlocking it.\n\n“Perfect, I’ll see you in fifteen then.”\n\nHe nodded and closed himself behind the door of his apartment, only after hearing the secure click and lock of hers. \n\n—\n\nElsa eyed the wall clock hung—more like laid—strategically next to her microwave: 8:38, 2 minutes before the 15 was up. \n\nShe bit her lips as she looked at the eggs frying in her pan, which were in their last few seconds before completion. She let out a breath of relief she didn’t know she was holding. \n\nTime feels infinitesimal when you have someone waiting for you at the end of it. \n\nAfter turning off the fire, she took her spatula and frantically clipped them between their respective sandwich slices, spraying them with a bit of soy sauce before closing them up and performing a clean diagonal slice. \n\nShe scurried a little more around her house, but before the longest hand on the clock could reach the number 12 a second time, Elsa was already out the door.\n\n—\n\nClick. \n\nJack looked up from his phone and grinned realizing it was the opening (and closing) of the door across from his. \n\n“Oh my,” Elsa turned around. “You’re here early.”\n\n“And you’re right on time,” he turned off his phone and grinned at her.\n\nConsequently, his eyes shifted from hers to the basket she was carrying, “That smells good, what is it?”\n\n“If I told you, I would be ruining the element of surprise.”\n\n“Come on, it wasn’t me asking.” He paused. “It was my stomach.”\n\nShe looked at him weirdly—with a hint of amusement—but mostly weirdly. “Nice try, Jackson.”\n\nJack chuckled as he picked up his pace to start walking beside her—instead of a few steps behind. “And all of a sudden, you’re my mother.”\n\nElsa shrugged and smiled as she made her way to the flight of stairs at the end of the hall.\n\nNaturally, he followed her. \n\nTo be quite frank, he never even knew their floor had a set of stairs—but thinking back—it would not have been great if they were without one either. \n\nBut who was he to know? The thought to use them never crossed his mind before; because, besides the awkward exchanges with people you technically live with, the making sure your posture is good—at least good enough—when in the presence of others, and the mindlessly scrolling through your photos to avoid a conversation about the weather, much less eye contact, elevators were a tenfold times better. \n\nBecause at least he wouldn’t have to walk.\n\n“How far do you think we’ll have to walk?” Elsa mumbled and stopped to look up, hoping to gauge how many more steps they had to overcome. \n\n“I think we’re on floor 14…?“ Jack wasn’t really sure himself. “And there’s like 20 stories, soo…” he dragged out the word. \n\n“So there are about 6 flights of stairs to climb,” Elsa finished it for him. “Dammit.” \n\nJack smirked at her choice of words. He didn’t take her for someone who would use expletives on the daily—or such words at all. \n\n“I can help you carry the basket,” he offered.\n\nShe stopped and turned back to look at him. He realized he had to look up to meet her eyes.\n\n“That’s quite alright,” she smiled and continued her pillage. \n\n“But—“\n\n“You’re already holding a lot anyways,” she said without turning back this time.\n\n“It’s really no trouble at all though, Elsa.”\n\nJack was beside her now, “Are you sure you don’t want any help with that?”\n\nShe looked smugly at him, “And have you look at what’s inside?” \n\nHe coughed. \n\n“No thank you.”\n\nOh well, you can’t fault him for trying. \n\n—\n\nCreak. \n\nElsa stepped over the threshold and onto the rooftop, basket in hand. \n\nJack whistled at her side. “And to think I’ve never been up here before.”\n\nAnd even though it was too dark to see the entirety of it, she smiled in agreement from what she could see. “Not too bad for a rooftop.”\n\n“Not too bad?” Jack side-eyed her. “It’s a great ass rooftop Elsa.” \n\nAs if to back up his claim, he pointed to their left, “Look at those lounge chairs.” And then to their right, “Look at that pool!”\n\nElsa all but laughed at him, “Come on, let’s find a place to settle down.” \n\n—\n\n“So can you finally tell me what’s for dinner now?” Jack asked as soon as he made himself comfortable on their picnic cloth; but really it was just something he found at the furthest corner of his closet—the one dedicated to sheets and pillowcases and bed commodities (only because his apartment was big enough for one). \n\n“Sure,” Elsa said as she, too, settled down on the blanket next to him—a little too close, he thought.\n\n“If you had any expectations, it’s best to lower them now,” she warned.\n\n“Won’t need to.” \n\n“Here,” she beckoned him to come closer to her opened basket. “It’s not a gourmet meal or anything; I only cook to relieve my stress.”\n\nJack leaned over and peaked inside the open basket, “Well, for a stress-reliever, you’re one hell of a good chef.”\n\nShe quirked her left eyebrow and rolled her eyes at his flattery, “Please, you haven’t even tasted it yet.”\n\n“So?” Jack shrugged. “The smell and presentation are just as important as the taste; it’s what makes a difference between a good chef and a great chef.”\n\n—\n\nJack noticed the amused look Elsa gave him.\n\n“At least that’s what my friend Jamie tells me all the time—he’s a food critic,” Jack added.\n\n“Imagine not only getting to eat good food but also getting paid for it,” Elsa said in jealousy while she worked to empty the basket of its contents.\n\n“Right?!” Jack guffawed. “And even after all that, he still wouldn’t refer me.”\n\n“Well,” she handed him a sandwich. “Do you think your taste buds are sensitive enough? What about your ability to put the taste into words?”\n\nHe took the sandwich and gave her a muffled thanks, “I guess not. But what kind of person would I be if I didn’t at least try? And what kind of person is he to not even refer me—his best friend?!”\n\nHe took a bite of his sandwich and his face (quite literally) lit up, “Holy shit, this is a good sandwich.”\n\n“Pff—” Elsa covered her snort with an open palm. “It’s literally just soy sauce, eggs, and a couple of tomato and cucumber slices.”\n\n“A combo I never thought of trying but would kill for a taste of again.”\n\n“Thanks, I guess?” Elsa wasn’t quite sure what to say to that. “My sister taught me it—and I guess she learned it from her boyfriend.”\n\n“Your sister?” Jack questioned. “The strawberry-blonde person who always visits you, right?”\n\n“Y—Yeah,” Elsa’s eyes rounded. “I’m glad you’ve seen her a… round?” And really, she was only assuming.\n\n“I’ve heard more than I’ve seen,” Jack corrected her. “You know, for how expensive and high-class our apartment complex is, you’d expect thicker walls.”\n\nElsa smiled knowingly, “Well, expensive or not, no wall can really contain her excitement and such.”\n\n“She seems like quite the character.”\n\n“You and her would get along.”\n\n“Would we?”\n\n“You know the thin walls thing works both ways, right?”\n\nShe was right; it does.\n\nHe couldn’t see her face that well in the pitch black but judging from her tone, he could tell she was smirking, “I’m glad you enjoy your time with your friends though.”\n\nHis cheeks grew hot and a sweat formed at the side of his forehead. \n\n“Just don’t stay up too late though.”\n\nJack laughed a nervous—and quite frankly, an embarrassed—laugh. “Thanks for the thought.” He coughed a bit on the former bite of food traveling down his throat. “I—I’ll keep that in mind.”\n\n—\n\nElsa couldn’t tell how much time had passed since they got here—but—she could at least tell that the hours had indeed moved quite a bit just from the stings of chills she felt through her jacket. \n\nAnd she hadn’t meant for her slight shiver to go heard.\n\n“Are you cold?” Jack asked from her side.\n\n“N—”\n\n“Here,” he handed her his blue hoodie. “You can put this on. Despite how it looks, it’s actually quite warm.”\n\nShe wasn’t sure whether or not Jack could see the subtle movement, but she nonetheless shook her head, “It’s fine, just slightly chilly.”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“You need it more than I do,” she countered. “Plus, it wouldn’t be fair if I double-layered when you’re only gonna be in a t-shirt.”\n\n“It’s really fine though.”\n\nShe saw his head quirk to the side.\n\nI guess we really can see each other’s movements in the dark.\n\n“The cold doesn’t bother me.”\n\n“But you shivered.”\n\n“Only because I thought about the temperature drop.”\n\n—\n\nJack squinted his eyes in confusion at what she said, “That makes no sense.”\n\n“It does if you think about it hard enough.”\n\n“Ahuh…”\n\nShe held a slightly desperate tone now, “It’s similar to when your body physically cringes if you think about something really…”\n\n“Cringeworthy?”\n\n“Yeah… cringeworthy—but I was looking for a more technical term.”\n\n“Okay…” Jack was beyond confused now. He had no idea where this conversation was going—he could roll with it—but that didn’t mean he knew where it was going. “Well, I’m not really bothered by the cold either.”\n\n“So?”\n\n—\n\n“So you should wear the hoodie.”\n\nElsa blinked at him. Truth be told, she was a little cold, but nowhere near enough for it to be an inconvenience for her.\n\n“I’m gonna get nowhere arguing with you over this, right?”\n\nShe could hear the smile tucked between his words, “Indeed.”\n\n“Fine.” \n\n—\n\nHe smiled a triumphant smile.\n\n—\n\nIf Elsa never had doubts about taking his hoodie, she was having them now. Even through two semi-thick layers, she could feel the continuing drop in temperature as the night got—well—nighter. \n\nShe wasn’t sure what the hell to do. Was he cold? Should she say something about the temperature? Or would it just remind him that he was cold? Is he going to awkwardly ask for it back? Sure she wouldn’t make the confrontation awkward—not intentionally at least—\n\n“The stars are pretty tonight,” his words brought Elsa back from her trailing thoughts.\n\nTheir dinner was long finished and they were laying down on their backs now, with nothing to do and nowhere to look but up at the sky.\n\nShe let him continue, “Although you can’t really see much because of the pollution.”\n\n“At least the blackout made some visible.”\n\nShe didn’t need to turn her face to him to know that he shrugged, “That’s true.”\n\nShe smiled in turn, “Do you like the sky?”\n\n“Like is an understatement. I love the night sky—hell I can even point out the planets we can see and name the stars and constellations—visible or not.”\n\nShe didn’t miss the blooming excitement in his throat and tone.\n\n—\n\n“Sometimes, I just wish I can become one with the wind and trust it to take me wherever, whenever, y’know?”\n\nAnd Jack wasn’t sure why he was telling his childhood dreams to someone whom he had just gotten the pleasure of knowing only a few hours ago; but here he was, spilling all his unsaid thoughts and hopes and imagination to said someone. \n\n“I get that.”\n\nHe felt the familiar traces of a growing smile.\n\n“Yup, wouldn’t it be awesome if we could do just that?”\n\nElsa sighed a contented sigh and added to their imagined possibility, “And leave the world and expectations and responsibility behind and do whatever we wanted to—if only just for a night.”\n\n“Well,” Jack started as he unwillingly pulled himself up and stretched. “The blackout wasn’t all that bad.” He extended a hand out to her.\n\n“Considering we sort of did just that.”\n\n—\n\n“We did?”\n\n“Yes, Elsa,” he smirked a knowing smirk at what was to come next. “We sort of did if you think about it hard enough.”\n\nJack’s words were left lingering in the air for a few seconds, but before Elsa could find the chance to respond—all of a sudden—the many lights that were once killed, lit up again.\n\nAnd if Elsa hadn’t known any better—if she hadn’t known what they were—she would dare think they were stars; the same ones in the sky, far beyond their lifetimes.\n\nRather than saying anything, she took his hand and pulled herself up.\n\n“Wow,” Jack breathed as he looked over the ledge and onto the city of Manhattan, in all its entirety and lights and liveliness once again. \n\n“The million dollar view is better from up here, huh?” Elsa sighed next to him. \n\n“Yup,” Jack smiled.\n\nAnd for a while, the two of them didn’t feel the need or pressure to do anything; letting time simply pass by around them was okay too.\n\n—\n\n“It’s about time we get back, right?” Jack questioned as he turned to his neighbor. \n\nHe then looked at his phone, “God, it’s almost 2 am.”\n\nElsa sighed a tired sigh and let a light laugh slip through, “We really should.”\n\n“But staying up here is okay too.”\n\n“Mhm,” she hummed in agreement. \n\n“How about a few more minutes?”\n\n“A few more minutes.”\n\nAnd he couldn’t help but smile again for the millionth time that night. \n\nTo be completely honest, his cheeks were starting to get sore—just a little though.\n\n—\n\n“I’ll see you tomorrow?” Elsa hadn’t meant for it to sound like a question, but it also would’ve been weird if it was a factual statement—she wasn’t quite sure where their relationship stands, nor was she aware of his daytime schedule to assume so either.  \n\nRegrettably. \n\n“Huh?” \n\n“Nothing,” her cheek flushed and she tightened her fingers around the handle of her basket. \n\n“But yeah,” the man smiled. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”\n\n“Okay!” she said, a little too enthusiastic. She bit her tongue to distract herself from how atrociously cringeworthy she was being right now. \n\nHe could probably see how red her face was. \n\nDamn these lights. \n\n“Okay,” he echoed and bit back a laugh—if she was running her mind again, then he didn’t say it out loud. “I’ll see you tomorrow then?”\n\nShe smiled a lopsided and awkward smile, “Yeah, I’ll see you.”\n\nHe mirrored her smile—awkwardness and all—and stood in front of his open door for a few more seconds. \n\n“Bye.”\n\n“Bye.”\n\n—\n\nAnd holy shit if that wasn’t the most awkward goodbye Jack had ever had the pleasure of living through.\n\nWhy so awkward, Jack? Because he didn’t really want their time to end. \n\nHe let out a sigh he was holding for the entirety of the exchange after he was finally behind his closed doors. \n\nNow would be as good as a time to finally go through his messages and respond to his concerned (upset) friends. \n\nJ-me: Jack, are you coming back?\n\nBunz: you’re gonna hear it from me when you come back, Frost. \n\naToothz: I just looked it up, holy shit the whole city’s in a blackout… are you okay?!\n\nBunz: @frostyboiii\n\nJ-me: @frostyboiii are you okay? Are you dead?\n\naToothz: should I drive to his apartment and check up on him?\n\nSand-man: 🙅\n\nJ-me: oKay, it’s been 4 hours, I’m convinced he’s dead \n\nBunz: I don’t doubt that LMAO\n\naToothz: guys, what if something did happen to him? \n\nBunz: well, we’ll never know now would we?\n\nJ-me: I’ll drop by his apartment on my way to that new restaurant tomorrow. \n\nBunz: inb4 you find his body \n\naToothz: 😭 \n\nfrostboiii: guys, chill, I’m right here\nAlive and healthy \n\nBunz: Unfortunately\n\nJ-me: welcome back\n\nfrostboiii: AWEE bunny you don’t mean that\n\nJ-me: I think tooth’s asleep rn but\nMind filling us in on\n\n—\n\n“What happened, Elsa?!” Anna exclaimed in bewilderment. \n\nElsa could very much see the widening of her sister’s hazel-colored eyes through the screen. \n\n“Slow down Anna! I’ll fill you in on everything”.\n\n“You fucking better, Elsa! I was worried sick!”\n\n“And I’m sorry for the tenth time tonight.”\n\n“I get that it’s a blackout Elsa but, radio silence—for well over four hours now,” Anna said exasperatedly. “In the middle of the fucking night no less!”\n\n“And I told you my phone was dead.”\n\n“Then? That’s no excuse bro, you should’ve went asking for a portable!”\n\nElsa snorted—she didn’t mean to snort at her sister’s lecture—but she did, “Funnily enough, I did.”\n\n“Who did you ask?“ Anna’s worrisome tone was replaced with a curious one now. \n\n“My neighbor from—\n\n—\n\nAcross the hall,” Jack said out loud to himself as he pressed enter. \n\nJ-me: the same one who u gushed about when you first moved in?\n\nBunz: he did WHAT?!\n\nfrostboiii: great Jamie, now the whole world knows. \n\nBunz: why didn’t I know of this before?\nHuh?\nJack\nJamie?!!\nDoes tooth know?\n\nfrostboiii: that’s not important right now\nLet me continue the story\n\nJ-me: yeah let him continue\n\nfrostboiii: okay so\n\n—\n\n“—that’s pretty much what happened,” Elsa was changed into her pajamas now and was sitting cross-legged on her bed, with her personal  MacBook sitting in front of her.\n\n“Holy shit holy shit holy fucking shit!” Anna squealed into her phone and Elsa removed one of her AirPods to avoid the ear rape from both ears. \n\n“Is he cute?!” \n\n“Well…”\n\n“You hesitated, so you do find him cute!!!”\n\nElsa swore she heard at least 5 exclamation points at the end of it. \n\n“Is he…” and even though she was in the kitchen (so as to not disturb her sleeping boyfriend) Anna lowered her voice an octave or three. “…hot?”\n\nTo which Elsa reluctantly nodded; lying to Anna—especially about this certain topic—was something behind her now. A few years behind. \n\n“Holy fucking shit, Elsa!” And whatever efforts were made to lower her voice was left in vain. \n\n“Language, Anna.”\n\n“Puh-lease bro, I’ve more or less been cursing this whole call.”\n\n“And I bet Kristoff can use less of that.”\n\n“Yeah yeah,” Anna waved her free hand. “I’ll hear about him tomorrow, tonight—or the rest of tonight—is for you.”\n\nElsa laughed, “What about me? I’ve pretty much gone and told you all of it.”\n\nAnna pouted, “Not everything.”\n\n“Oh yeah? Ask away then.”\n\n“What do—\n\n—\n\n“—I THINK OF HER?!” Jack shouted as he read the new message that appeared at the bottom of his chat logs. \n\nAnd then, almost reflexively, he gasped and brought his hand over his mouth.\n\nWhat are the chances that Elsa’s awake? What are the chances that she heard that? What are the chances she concludes that it’s about her (with good reasoning too)? \n\nfrostboiii: HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIRH TOU BNNY I FUCKING SWEAR TO GOD TOU ARE SO GONA GET IT FROM ME RHE NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER \n\nJack was typing in all caps now—and even though Bunny couldn’t hear his anger—he at least should be able to tell just how fucking pissed Jackson Frost Overland was—caps and all.\n\nJ-me: relax Jack\n\nfrostboiii: BEJFJKSKWKD I CSNT\n\nBunz: what even happened m8, I did nothing\n\nfrostboiii: I fuckijg yelled your text at the top of my lungs and she prob heard it \nwait. \nwhat are the chances she’s heard it? Low right?\n\nBunz: and this is my fault how???\n\nJ-me: dawg that was just you being stupid \n\nSandman: 😂 \n\nBunz: hi sandy\n\nSandman: 👋 \n\nfrostboiii: holy shittttttttttt I hate my life\n\nJ-me: so how are you not gonna answer the question?\n\nfrostboiii: UGHHHHH haven’t I been through enough guys?\n\nBunz: no\n\nfrostboiii: ugh I hate you guys\nBut\n\nJ-me: ?\n\nfrostboiii: well\nI\nI think she’s a very attractive person with an even more attractive—\n\n—\n\n—personality.”\n\nAnna chuckled at her sister’s description of the man in question, “You genuinely think he’s funny?”\n\nElsa nodded, “In his own way.”\n\n“Well, you don’t see that every day, I never thought I’d see the day my sister would find anyone funny.”\n\nElsa quirked her lips, clearly unimpressed.\n\n“So are you guys friends?”\n\nElsa went silent for a moment, “Actually, I’m not quite sure. I don’t know what he considers me as.”\n\n“After going through all that, I’m sure you guys are at least friends.”\n\n“Oh gosh, I hope so.”\n\n“What about plans? Did—\n\n—\n\n“—we make any plans?”\n\nBunz: what the hell else did I ask, m8 \n\nJ-me: ngl Jack I think the sleep deprivation and grass touching got to you.\n\nfrostboiii: stfu\nAnd no we didn’t make any more\n\nBunz: aweeeee, even after your great time together on the rooftop?\n\nJ-me: did she reject you?\n\nfrostboiii: no I didn’t ask her\n\nBunz: ROFL\n\nJ-me: LOL \n\nfrostboiii: should I—\n\n—\n\n“—have asked him?”\n\nElsa didn’t miss the roll of Anna’s eyes through her yawn. \n\n“Well, do you want to hang out with him again?”\n\n“I’m not against it.”\n\nAnna smiled, “Then yes my older sister, yes you should have asked him for a next time.”\n\n“When should—\n\n—\n\n“—I do it?”\n\nBunz: rn\n\nJ-me: right now?\n\nfrostboiii: WHAT it’s literally almost 3 am bruh\n\nJ-me: knowing you, you won’t be able to sleep if you don't…\n\nSandman: ^^\n\nfrostboiii: well yeah but that’s inconsiderate towards her\n\nJ-me: just give her door a single ring\n\nBunz: mhm, and if she doesn’t open the door after the first one then we know she’s passed out \n\nfrostboiii: okay but what if I wake her up??\n\nJ-me: your bell isn’t that loud though???\n\nfrostboiii: what if she’s a light sleeper?\n\nBunz: it’s almost 3 in the morning, she’s prob in deep sleep counting rabbits in her dreams or something \n\nJ-me: yup\n\nfrostboiii: okay but what if we wake up our neighbors with our conversation??\n\nBunz: holy shit and you’re just thinking up of excuses now. \n\nJ-me: ^^^^ now is better than\n\n—\n\n“—later, Elsa,” Anna sighed at her sister’s common sense—or rather—lack of.\n\nElsa stayed silent. \n\n“Or you know, you can not ask him and possibly regret it for the rest of your life and then just return to being awkward neighbors—because really—that’s totally fine too!” Anna exclaimed, voice and tone a little too fake.\n\nElsa’s face contorted in disgust at her sister’s tone, “Ew, don’t talk like that.”\n\nAnna shrugged as she left the frame for a bit and came back with ice cream.\n\n“You’re gonna get a cavity.”\n\n“Not if I just brush my teeth again.”\n\n“Still…”\n\n“How about we stop talking about my late night choices and go back to talking about yours instead?”\n\n“Okay…” Elsa hesitated. “What should—\n\n—\n\nI do?\n\nJ-me: go out and ring her bell bro\n\nBunz: what the fuck else???\n\nfrostboiii: if this fails I’m going to blame you guys\n\nJ-me: it—\n\n—\n\n“—won’t!” Anna half-shouted and then proceeded to shove another spoonful of chocolate ice cream up her mouth. \n\nShe held up a single finger, signaling Elsa to wait a bit for the food to go down. \n\nA chill silent and then, “I am one hundred—thousand—percent sure everything will be fine, Elsa.”\n\n“Doubtful.”\n\n“What’s the worst—“\n\n—\n\n…she can say, Jack?\n\nfrostboiii: you don’t ask that to someone who ran thousands of what-if scenarios in his head in the last hour or so. \nYou just don’t. \n\nJ-me: bro, stop\n\n—\n\n“—overthinking it!”\n\n“Fine—“\n\n—\n\nfine!\nFuck you guys\nCause holy fucking shit\nIf this\nIsn’t the\n\n— \n\n“—dumbest thing ever, then I don’t know what is.”\n\n“But you’re still gonna do it, right?” Anna asked hopefully, eyebrows raised in curiosity and held up in the air at the suspense.\n\n—\n\nBunz: holy shit y’all he’s gonna do it\n\nJ-me: are you in front of her door?\n\n—\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Go go go, go right now!” \n\n“Okay, okay, I’ll be right back.”\n\n—\n\nfrostboiii: I’m at her door and I feel like I’m gonna shit my pants\n\nBunz: well don’t\n\nJ-me: come on Jack, get off your phone and ring the god damn bell\n\nfrostboiii: okok, if u guys don’t hear back then have tooth Uber me breakfast, lunch and dinner tomorrow\n\nHe let out a sigh. \n\nfrostboiii: here I go\n\nHe turned off his phone and reached—\n\n—\n\n—for the door.\n\n—\n\nCreak. \n\n“Oh, hi Jack!”\n\nJack’s eyes widened when he saw that Elsa had opened the door before he could gather the courage to actually push the goddamn bell. \n\n—\n\nHoly shit, thank god for this coincidence. \n\n“D-did you need something?”\n\nShe almost felt sorry about the look on Jack’s face if not for her relief. \n\n—\n\nHe let out a nervous chuckle, bit his lips, and scratched the nape of his neck. \n\nHe felt his phone vibrate in his hands and thought he could hear Bunny and Jamie through the device.\n\nDo it bro!\n\nWhat are you waiting for?!!!\n\nAnd then he opened his mouth.\n\n—\n\n“I—“\n\nElsa looked up at him—head nodding—a sign for him to continue. \n\n—\n\nAnd Jack figured he couldn’t go through with it, “You know what it was nothing, really, I just couldn’t sleep—actually, I might be sleepwalking—who knows?”\n\n—\n\nHe ruffled his hair and Elsa felt a pang of disappointment—and doubt. \n\n“I—I should head back.”\n\n“Wait!” \n\nAnd if Elsa didn’t speak up then and there, then she doubted she would ever. \n\n“Yes?”\n\n—\n\nJack’s heart leaped up to his throat and he fought to push it back down—so he could avoid the disappointment if it came. \n\n“D-did,” he gulped. “Did you need anything?”\n\n—\n\nElsa’s mind was running laps and the saliva was drained from her mouth.\n\nShe opened her mouth and sucked in a breath of air.\n\n—\n\n“Elsa?”\n\n—\n\n“I was wondering if…” \n\nIt’s not too late to back out you know—and shut the door on him.\n\n—\n\nJack cautiously stepped closer to her. His head was malfunctioning and he was losing all traces of logic and rationale. \n\n“If…?” He repeated after her, hoping she didn’t catch the hope in his tone. \n\n—\n\n“If you’re free tomorrow?”\n\n\n"

{"text": "“You’re fucking kidding…” \n\n“I fucking wish I was.” \n\n“No way you’re next-door neighbors with THE Jackson Overland fucking Frost.”\n\n“Okay, can we stop cursing…”\n\n“Fuck no.”\n\nIn which Jack moves in right next to Elsa and one fateful night brings them closer together. \n\n(Or, when a troll pulled the fire alarm, forcing her entire apartment building to evacuate outside at 2 fucking AM; Elsa in her most (un)flattering pair of pajamas and Jackson Overland Frost in his underwear.) \n\n“You’re fucking kidding me.”\n\nElsa’s mumbling back to back to back expletives to herself, cursing the damn card in her hand and the damn building owner for ever thinking it was a good idea to convert to—and consequently rely on—technology for yet another thing in her apartment complex. \n\n“Technology, am I right?” A low voice speaks up right beside her, followed by a chuckle—an oddly seductive chuckle that most definitely would’ve turned her legs to butter if she was still in high school—or if her first name was Anna.\n\n“Yeah,” she removes her attention from the scanner—that’s apparently supposed to be her lock by the way—and looks at the owner of the voice. \n\nHer eyes are met with a bright, piercing blue and possibly the most gorgeous face she’s ever seen in person. (And that in itself was impressive because New York City—the city she's been able to call home for the last three years—isn’t short of his kind). \n\nShe gulps and hopes he doesn’t notice the look on her face—she hopes he doesn’t notice anything about her to be honest, drool included.  \n\n“Hi,” he flashes a toothy grin at her and tilts his head and waves. “I’m your new neighbor, Jack.”\n\n“Hi, I’m Elsa,” she echoes as she slowly brings her key card back to the scanner and prays he doesn’t notice her scrambled action. \n\nBeep. Then, click. \n\nThey both turn to her door, now slightly ajar. She smiles at him—awkward and sorry and ‘see you around?’. \n\nHe nods and repeats her empty promise out loud for the both of them. “See you around.” \n\n—-\n\n\n“Wait, wait wait wait,” Anna stops Elsa in the middle of her rant—about how technology is stupid and how we shouldn’t be entirely reliant on them and how there should still be a fucking option for tenants to still use keys. “Repeat his name again?”\n\n“Whose name?” Elsa asks as she leans away from the screen and lays on her couch. \n\n“Your neighbor’s, duh,” Anna clarifies. “Who else?”\n\nElsa rolls her eyes at her little sister’s sass but chooses not to comment on it, at least not tonight. “Jack.”\n\n“Jack…?” Anna edges on for the rest of it. \n\n“That’s the extent of what I know.”\n\n“And you… you mentioned he’s hot as fuck, right?” Anna looks thoughtful. \n\n“Okay, I didn’t say that,” Elsa, being the dignified woman she is, fights to defend herself. \n\n“But you were implying it,” the strawberry blonde rolls her eyes as she brings her laptop closer to her and types something in it. \n\n“Jack…” Elsa can hear her sister repeat her neighbor’s name under her breath. \n\nA slight gasp escaped her lips and, “Uh, Elsa…” \n\n“Hm?”\n\n“By chance, does your neighbor…”\n\n“Does he…?”\n\n“Happen to have white, silvery hair?”\n\nElsa gasps and gets up from her couch. “How—how do you know?”\n\n“You’re…” her sister looks at her, shock visible through the screen. “You’re not kidding, right sis?”\n\n“Why would I lie about my neighbor’s hair color,” Elsa guffaws at her own sister’s skepticism. \n\n“You’re fucking kidding…” \n\n“I fucking wish I was.” \n\n“No way you’re next-door neighbors with THE Jackson Overland fucking Frost.”\n\n“Okay, can we stop cursing…”\n\n“Fuck no.”\n\n“Jackson Overland Frost, as in…” It’s now Elsa’s turn to start typing things into her MacBook. \n\nEnter. \n\n“The fucking hottest super fucking model around?” Anna finishes for her. \n\nElsa’s words got caught in her throat and Anna can’t stand not knowing any longer. \n\n“Elsa, I know you fucking googled him—“\n\n“Safari’d… I safari’d him.”\n\n“Yeah whatever,” Anna is getting impatient, Elsa can hear it in her tone and see it in her movements through the screen. “The point is… you have his face right in front of you… right?”\n\nElsa nods. \n\n“And?!” Anna’s voice raises an octave, or three. “Is it him?”\n\nElsa nods. \n\nAnna screams. \n\nElsa winces and prays to god her said neighbor next door can’t hear it. \n\n“No FUCKING way, no fucking way,” Anna fans herself—from what, Elsa does not know. “And he knows your name?!”\n\n“I think?”\n\n“You’re free tomorrow right?”\n\n“I should be, it’s a Saturday.”\n\n“Okay, okay, I’m coming first thing tomorrow.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“To scout him.”\n\n“But Kristoff—?”\n\n“Not for me dummy.”\n\n“Who the fuck th—?”\n\n“For you.”\n\nOh. \n\n—-\n\n\nThankfully, nothing fruitful came from Anna’s visit, besides her edging turned pestering into insisting and finally, begging. \n\n“But—your kids will be so cute?!”\n\nElsa hasn’t got a damn clue where she gets her crazy fantasies and—quite frankly—her imaginative imagination from. \n\nBecause Elsa was the exact opposite: down to earth and pessimistic and real. \n\nSuffice to say, it has been a few months since her new neighbor had moved in—more specifically, five months and a week—but no one knows she was counting the damn days. \n\nBecause sure, sure—she admits it—her neighbor is drop-dead fucking gorgeous. \n\nWhenever her thoughts were trailing, they would always, without a single fail, settle on the idea of his fluffy (messy) white hair, his ice blue (mesmerizing) eyes, his sharp (Greek god) jawline—and really her head can probably go on and on and on if given enough time to do so. \n\nBut whenever she finds her mind losing itself, she would always beeline to the sink and slap a handful of cold water onto her face.\n\nA much needed reality check. \n\nShe then forces herself to remember the many kinds of women he would bring into his apartment—and reminds herself of the painful fact that those are the times she’s seen him—he could very well be bringing three or four times as many as that. \n\nBut she ends up questioning that thought because—at the end of the day—she doesn’t need to see him to know. Other times, she can hear it. \n\nAnd Elsa is a dignified woman, so a crush is what she will always let it be. \n\nNow, five months and a week in, she finds herself sitting at the corner of her bed in one of her many, many, pairs of one of her more—‘revealing’ pajamas, toes curling and uncurling themselves in her snowman slippers, sending Anna a good night text. \n\nShe settles down and closes her eyes. \n\nBeep beep beep. \n\n—\n\nShe hides her yawn behind an open palm as she stands on the street—in her (let’s be real) lingerie and (soon to be no longer) white snowman slippers. \n\nThere were dozens—hundreds—of people stranded and idly standing on the empty streets of New York City, all confused and probably thinking the same damn thing: why the fuck am I here?\n\nShe sighs to herself and crosses her arms against her (immodest) chest and tries her best to tunnel her vision to her slippers. Because if she looks anywhere else, her eyes will one hundred fucking percent, choose to settle to the man on her left: Jackson Overland fucking Frost. \n\nBut she finds it hard not to steal a glance—or four. And just as quickly, her eyes would always, without fail, dart back to her feet; and she wiggles her toes a bit to distract herself from her wild, dirty, thoughts. \n\nBecause \n\nJackson Overland fucking Frost—as Anna likes to call him—was ridiculously hot; there is no other way to be modest about it and he just so happens to be about of similar age to her (thanks Safari). \nSaid hot dude is standing right next to her; but if she is to get technical about it, they are still a foot apart. But still, he can probably hear her poor heart hyperventilate from their single foot apart. \nHe is in his underwear. She repeats: he is in his fucking boxers; with snowflake patterns on them. And she thinks that it’s cute—she groans at that thought. \nAll the women (and some men)—single or not—were ogling him too. And as the dignified woman she is, she doesn’t want to be a part of that group (though there is no shame—because really—she understands, probably more than anyone).\nShe can’t seem to forget about the bulge from his underwear—no matter how many happy and wholesome thoughts she thinks. \n\nIf it wasn’t the building that was (possibly) on fire—she would be the one to combust instead. \n\nSo to distract herself some more, she bites her lips and twiddles her fingers and hugs herself a little tighter and rocks back and forth—for the sake of having something else to focus on. \n\n“Hey,” in her vision, she notices a pair of feet and bright blue slides. \n\nShe gulps; she knows this voice, she’s spent countless nights dreaming about it. \n\n“Hi,” she looks up. \n\n“Elsa, right?”\n\nHer mouth is dry but she still swallows and ignores the plethora of jealous side eyes and glares sent her way at about the same time, “Yup.”\n\n“I’m not sure if you remember me, but,” he slips a (fatal) laugh in between his words.  “I’m Jack, your neighbor next door.”\n\n“I know,” she feels a bead of sweat trickle down the side of her face. \n\nAnd really, she can’t always be the awkward next-door neighbor with a schoolgirl crush forever. She wills herself to be better—more mature and professional, “We’ve met before.” \n\nShe clarifies and smiles a half smile. \n\n“Yeah, I remember,” he returns her smile, but instead of awkward and cute, it’s a devilishly charming and seductive smirk. “I had just moved in that day and you were—“\n\nShe decides to cut him off there, “Struggling with my key card—yeah—not one of my proudest first encounters.”\n\nHe laughs and suggests a thought she finds absolutely crazy, “Well, we can try again.” \n\nShe blinks and feels the blood rush to her face.\n\nIs he flirting with her?\n\nShe laughs awkwardly instead, “We already are.” She extends a hand out to him, “I’m Elsa Arendelle, your next-door neighbor.”\n\nHe looks down at her open hand and chuckles the same damn chuckle that always seems like it was out to get her. “Hi, Elsa. I’m Jack. Jackson Overland Frost, your next-door neighbor.”\n\nHer eyes soften and she feels a little tinge of relief wash over her. She knows she has to be half-honest and meet his sincerity with her own, “Actually, I know that too.” \n\nHe stares at her. \n\n“Well—everyone—at least every woman—knows who you are,” she laughs an even more awkward laugh than before, internally cringing at her attempts to save herself from being deemed creepy. “And my sister—Anna—told me who you were.”\n\n“Ah, I see,” he nods and understands. “Well—if we’re being honest, Snowflake—“\n\nSnowflake?\n\n“I know who you are too,” he smiles and she finds it hard not to be blinded by his bright white teeth. She understands now—she thinks—why that one girl who he would bring home some nights, the one with the rainbow hair, would always comment on his teeth. \n\n“I know your last name’s Arendelle and that you’re a lawyer,” he finishes and brings her back to the present. \n\n“You—you know?”\n\nHe nods, “I asked around.”\n\nShe gulps.\n\nAh. So he’s asked her around about her before. Does this mean he’s interested?\n\nHe might be—but at the same time, all those girls he fucked—okay but—she would sometimes bring a few guys home too. \n\nDefinitely not as much as he does though. \n\nBut they aren’t leaving the ‘friendly neighbors' zone soon, so she shouldn’t think too much about it. \n\n“Elsa?”\n\n“I—I see,” she recovers. “That’s a bit creepy, don’t you think?” \n\nShe should just leave this old schoolgirl crush behind, \n\n“Hey hey—“ he playfully defends himself. “It’s only fair, you know a lot about me too.” \n\nBecause if she does, she has a feeling they can be great friends. \n\n“It’s public information,” she rolls her eyes. “Everyone knows a lot about you.”\n\n“Well—it’s still unfair that my neighbor knows more about me than I know about her.”\n\n“Whatever you say, Jack Frost.”\n\n“In my defense,” he uses the nickname she was given back in high school. “Snow Queen,”\n\nHow the hell does he know her high school nickname?\n\nShe wonders but plays it off, “Okay… all of a sudden you know my past now?”\n\n“Well—“ he stammers for the first time that night—probably for the first time ever in his life—and coughs, “I—I heard about it when I was asking around… about you.”\n\nShe raises her eyebrow at him and tries to act cool and coy and tries to give off the impression that she’s in the right—or at least she tries to make sure that he can’t tell that she’s about to explode from her heart working overtime. \n\nPriorities, right?\n\n“My point exactly,” she states. \n\n“Hey—I just wanted to know more about you…”\n\nIs he trying to get into her pants?\n\nShe shoos the thought away and instead laughs a soft laugh, “Well, you can come to the source next time.”\n\nHe’s about to say something—she sees those damn lips open—but the sirens are blaring and getting closer so no one talks instead. \n\nA few seconds later, four firemen came running by.\n\nShe wonders if Tadashi is one of them. \n\n—\n\n“You’re fucking kidding me.”\n\n“So… it was just some idiot that pulled the alarm?!”\n\n“Do we at least know who?”\n\nElsa hears the first few tenants, the ones closest to the door and the group of firemen and manager, complain. \n\nShe feels herself get a bit annoyed and grow a bit impatient and she’s about to join the swarm making their way back inside until—\n\n“Elsa?” One of the firemen came up to her. “I knew this was your building!”\n\n“Tadashi!” Her face unfolds itself and her eyes beam. “Gosh, it’s been a while.”\n\nFor the first time that night, she unwraps both hands from her body—forgetting about her improper nightgown—and welcomes her childhood friend in for a hug. \n\n“Funny thing,” she adds during their embrace. “I was wondering if I was going to see you tonight.”\n\n“Funnier thing,” Tadashi comments when they’re apart again. “This wasn’t even supposed to be my shift.” \n\n“No—“\n\nAhem. \n\nThe pair look to their left. \n\n“Elsa,” Jack calls to her—tone a little too suggestive but strict and a tad bit deeper. “It’s time we get back inside.” \n\n“Oh, you can go ahe—“\n\n“No.” \n\n“No?” She parrots his word, justifiably confused. \n\n“Elsa?” Tadashi chirps in. “Do you know this guy? Is he—“\n\n“He’s my next-door neighbor, but—“ she looks from hot childhood friend to hot neighbor model. “But that’s as far as our relationship goes.”\n\nShe winces as she notices Jack’s expression darken. \n\n“Mhm,” he rushes his next few words, “Hi Elsa’s friend, I’m Jack—her next-door neighbor—and it’s getting late and we’re out here for no other fucking reason for the amusement of a troll and I was just about to walk her back inside, so if you don’t mind—“\n\nHe puts himself next to her and softly weaves his fingers into hers. \n\nTadashi looks a little confused at this sudden development but his face has nothing on Elsa’s. \n\nYup. The building isn’t the one on fire—it’s her. \n\nShe prays and prays and prays that Jack can’t feel the sweat forming on her palms. \n\n“I’m going to take her back—“ he coughs. “To her place.”\n\nTadashi smiles awkwardly, “Okay thanks, Jack. I’m counting on you.”\n\nElsa swears she heard Jack mumble something under his breath. \n\n“No need.”\n\n—-\n\n\nBy the time Jack drags Elsa back in through their lobby doors, she notices the crowd thins; hundreds turned to dozens turned to few—here and there.\n\nThey enter the elevator together and Elsa mentally prepares herself for the awkward flight of nineteen stories that were to ensue. \n\n“So… that firefighter back then is your friend?”\n\nShe nods and gives him the necessary context, “Yeah, we’re childhood friends.”\n\n“I see,” he doesn’t pry for more—something she appreciates.\n\nNeither of them speaks for the rest of the climb and eventually; they were on the 20th floor.\n\nThe elevator dings and the doors slide open and Jack lets Elsa step out first before following close behind her. \n\nThey walk the rest of the hall in silence. \n\nJack eventually does the talking again, “You know… I meant it right?”\n\n“Hm?” she flips her head at him, face a little tired and confused. \n\n“About wanting to learn more about you—to get to know you better.”\n\nHer lips form the shape of a knowing ‘o’. Blood swims up to her cheeks, tinting them a slight pink, “I’m flattered.”\n\n“Will I see you again?” Jack feels a surge of confidence in his feet. \n\nElsa fights the sleep away and smiles at him, “Sure.”\n\nShe sees his smile finds its way across his face, “Promise we won’t just be neighbors anymore?”\n\n“Promise,” Elsa finds herself mirroring his wide smile. “I’ll visit… tomorrow night?”\n\nJack’s wholesome smile morphs into a smirk, “Sure… but—”\n\nShe quirks her head a little bit to the side, waiting for him to finish his sentence before she decides to unlock and open her door. \n\n“Be sure to visit wearing…” his eyes travel the whole length of her. “This.”\n\nThe woman yelps and doesn’t let him finish his goodbye and slams the door on his stupid model face. \n\nBehind the door, her ears catch his chuckle and something more:\n\n“Goodnight, Snowflake.”\n\n—-\n\nHams.Tadashi\nAnna, where were you tonight…\n\nAnnaBanana\nUhm… why?\nHams.Tadashi\nIstg I saw strawberry blonde exit Elsa’s building…\nWhen the fire department came\nAnnaBanana\n*Gasps* You don’t think it’s me, do you?\nI meannnn\nCome on\nThere’s like… hundreds of strawberry blondes in NYC\nHams.Tadashi\nWell… that’s funny because I saw a streak of white in their ponytail as well\nAnna?\nHello?\nIt’s you, isn’t it?"

{"text": "It was a beautiful night and he knew it. Stars sprinkled unevenly everywhere as if a white paintbrush was flicked over the neverending blanket of the dark canvas. Not so subtle streaks of purple and green kept the lonely color company. There wasn’t a single cloud in his peripheral.\n❄❄❄❄❄❄❄❄\nHe was almost there. \nSquinting, he saw the familiar silhouette of the castle and the rest of Arendelle serving as its backdrop.  Almost simultaneously, the wind, which kept him from gravity’s grasp, hesitated— more than it already has since his trek from the North Pole. \nNormally, Jack would’ve been ecstatic to visit his queen’s abode. But tonight was different.\nAfter tonight, he would no longer have a reason to. \nThere would be no more Elsa to tease and spoil. No more crazy Anna shipping and fangirling over the Winter Spirit and his Snow Queen. No more stealing glances at the eternally graceful and ever-beautiful girl as she sits at her desk, scratching her pen over some sort of letter or document that would steal her attention from him. No more late-night talks where both ice deities would only suffer its aftermath when the rest of the world woke from slumber in all directions.\nNo more incentive to visit after tonight— unless he wants his heart to shatter into pieces, more than it already has.\nIf that’s even possible.\nHe shook the haunting thoughts out of his head as quickly as it came. \n\tYou shouldn’t be out and about wasting your time. He scolded himself.\n\tYou may have the rest of forever to waste but she doesn’t.\nAnd in what felt like an eternity, even for the fun and mischievous, winter spirit, Jack Frost, he was at the edge of Arendelle castle. At last. \n❄❄❄❄❄❄❄\nBeing in the presence of the towering doors was foreign to him. If given the option between the intimidating doors and Elsa’s window, he would always opt with the latter. \nBut tonight was different.\nHe had a feeling that Anna was at her sister’s bedside. Intruding on their last moments together would be the last thing he wanted— apart from Elsa leaving him forever of course.\nAs considerate as he was, his pondering was cut short when he came across the first person he’d see all night.\nThe guard, a few feet away from him, silently acknowledged his presence and led him through one of the doors, into the halls. Apart from a few servants who passed by the unusual duo, the castle was empty and quiet. \nAcknowledgments and greetings were mutually made through eye contact and subtle nods. \nNo one saw fit to speak or make any more sound than was necessary, afraid that the noise would disturb the shared solemnity and stab the blanket of grief. \nAs the distance between Elsa’s room and him shortened, the lower the temperature got. Although he tried to be discreet, the guard subtly shivered at the sudden change. But Jack was indifferent to it. Like his counterpart, the cold never bothered him anyway. \nYards turned into feet and feet turned into inches. Finally, like all journeys, his dreaded one came to a halt. \nJack was finally here. He was mere centimeters away from her door.\nAfraid to be in the presence of the spirit’s sorrow, the guard motioned his farewells and scurried back to his original post. \nAs for Jack, like the wind that carried him thousands of miles here, he hesitated. Who was he to knock and cut short the remaining time the royal sisters had together? \nPlus, his dying lover was on the other side of this door. And the thought killed him.\n❄❄❄❄❄❄\nLuckily, he didn’t have to knock.\nThe door was opened and a waft of even colder air wrapped around his pale face. From the newfound darkness of the room, he could see strawberry blonde emerge from it. \nAnna was crying. \nCrying was an understatement.\nJack looked at Anna’s tear-stained face. He didn’t know that the always cheerful, goofy, fun, and loving Anna was capable of making such a face. Worse, he didn’t know if Anna would ever return to her once bubbly self. She had already spent a decade or so without her sister. And spending the rest of her life without Elsa was way too cruel. \nKristoff, who looked just as bad as his wife followed behind her, his giant hand on her shaking shoulders.\nThe husband-wife pair walked past Jack, both parties silently addressing each other.\nAnna quickly walked away from the hall, not wanting to be near Elsa when she takes her final breath. And Jack couldn’t blame her. How can anyone go on living if they witnessed the passing of someone so dear to them. \nShortly behind her, Kristoff gave Jack a most pitiful look before following Anna down the hall, hoping to not only console her but himself as well. \nNow all there was before Jack was himself. And an open door. \n❄❄❄❄❄\nElsa was already long gone. But how she would give up her life time and time again if she never had to see Anna’s face stricken with tears. Even as her dear sister’s retreating back is turned from her, the mixture of hicks, screams, whimpers, and sobs etch the back of her mind. \nShe wasn’t scared of death, never was, never is. But the unwelcoming sensation of fear crept into her mind as she imagined how the life of her loved ones would be without her beside them. Her beloved kingdom would recover from their queen’s passing under Anna and Kristoff’s rule. That she knew, but what about the rulers themselves?\nWill Anna ever be the same?\nWhat about Kristoff?\nSven? Olaf?\nJack? \nJack. \nHer thoughts naturally drift to Jack. She knew he was immortal. She knew this day would come eventually. But the said ill-fated day came too soon. \nFor the first time tonight, she didn’t want eternal slumber to take her from her family. No, not yet. \nHer melancholy thoughts fizzled out as she heard a light sigh at her door. A sigh so soft that any other type of noise would drown it out. Except, there was no other noise in the vicinity, besides two beating hearts and their ever so subtle breathing. \nHer head snapped to the source so fast, it seemed like she practiced doing so all her life— waiting for the right moment to do so. \n“Jack?”\n❄❄❄❄\n\t“Jack?” Elsa stared at him quizzically.\n\tHis head snapped up to the source of her melodious voice.\nNo matter how many hours he spent listening intently to her, to every story she shared, to every one of her rants, her airy— yet soft spoken voice was a song he never could get tired of. Not now, not for the rest of eternity. \nHe flashed her a light, dejected smile as he approached her bed and sat down beside her. \nHer room was cold, even for Jack himself, someone who was so used to the unpleasant temperature. \nEven with the only source of light coming from Elsa’s window and underneath the now-closed door, Jack could still clearly see Elsa’s face as if it was day. How could he not? It was the face that spent so much time cupped in his cold, lanky hands.\n“How are you feeling?” He asked her as he usually does when she comes down with a cold— which is super rare in itself. \n“I’m fine. I think it’s getting better actually,” she responded sarcastically returning his smile with her usual crooked one.\n❄❄❄\nJack held her stare for a few seconds before he decided to speak again.\n“I wish it would get better,” he pouted. \nDespite her worsening condition and hitched breathing, she couldn’t help but find Jack adorable, even when he looked as down as he was. \n“Me too,” she responded, matching his gaze. \nA provoking silence, aside from the Queen’s heavy breathing, followed. \nElsa could feel her time slipping. She had so many things she wanted to tell her immortal lover, she didn’t want to waste it, sitting in the deafening silence. \nAs Jack silently breaks down in front of her, the subject of his torment opened her mouth but no sound came out of those delicate, quivering lips. \nHer vocal cords struggled to function properly so she resorted to conveying her many many thoughts in hushed whispers, hoping Jack would catch every word as they fell from her breath— like how snowflakes descend from the sky. \n❄❄\n“Remember when we first met?” she whispered so faintly that if Jack wasn’t sitting just a few inches from her, he wouldn’t have caught it. \n“How could I not?” he replied, reciprocating her feathery whisper as he recalled their first encounter that one winter night in Arendelle just 20 years ago. \n“I thought you were the prettiest girl in the entire world,” he continued. \n“Really?” Elsa looked at him skeptically. “In your 300 or so years of being immortal and on top of your human years? I doubt that.”\n“But it’s true though.” \nAnd oh boy was it true, then and now. Even when the unwelcomed symptoms of aging wedged its way onto her once flawless skin, she was still the most beautiful girl he’d ever had the pleasure of looking at.\nElsa stared at him, visibly expressing her displeasure at how corny he was— something unnatural for his usual mischievous self.\nHe stared back. Breaking her gaze was unheard of.\nHand in hand in the recurring ear-piercing silence, with Jack sitting at his lover’s bedside and said lover sitting upright on her bed, the two looked at each other. \nNo longer did Elsa feel the need to spill all her unspoken thoughts onto Jack. Even without spending the rest of eternity together, the similar— yet so different winter mortal and immortal pair knew what the other was thinking. \n. . .\nTheir unspoken conversation went on for what felt like forever, and for once in his ‘life’, Jack was fine with the idea of it. \nBut even forever must come to an end. \n5.\n“You know I love you,” mouthed Elsa.\n\t“I know. I love you too.”\n\t4.\n“Find love again, okay?”\n“I won’t,” he hummed. \nHow could he?\n3.\n“But don’t forget me.”\n“I won’t.”\nOnce again, how could he?\n2.\n“I love nights like these.”\n“I know you do.”\n1.\n”You’ll always have me.”\n“I know.”\nAnd along with her last breath, two beating hearts become one. \nThe silence was pierced with sobs from the last person anyone expected them from— Jack. \n❄\n\tSome time passed before he decided it was time to go. \nAs if on cue for the curtain call, the first hint of sunrise unveiled itself, it’s introduction disturbing the, once, perfect night sky’s solo. \nAnna came back to the room she was forbidden from for most of her childhood, to an open window, just missing Jack’s departure. \n~\nIt’s been a decade or so since the Man in the Moon came for her, but Jack would always aimlessly find his way back to Arendelle. \nAs the rest of the world continues to move and as time continues to run, her absence in this life would be minuscule. Despite that, he saw the whole world in her, but what good is it without the rest of eternity? \nHe stared aimlessly at the moon, the subject to his constant pleas and cries to bring her back to him, claiming it was the least it could do as it was also responsible for his immortality and powers— something he never requested to begin with. \nToo bad, Jack thought.\nIt was a night she would have adored. \n\n\n"

{"text": "\tUgh.\n\tElsa grunted as one of the first few drops of liquid ascends from the sky, staining her cheek. What was thought of as an innocent droplet soon multiplied into a shower of glittering beads that descended almost simultaneously one after another— much to Elsa’s dismay.\n\tThe city was shortly wrapped in a blanket of gray clouds, little remnants of the sun fighting to shine through. But as quickly as it came, the rainclouds worked fast to curtain the deity, its rays no longer visible as the world beneath it retreated to shelter. \n\tIt was an unwelcomed sight to behold.\n\tThanks to the weather’s 180-degree turn, the almost sudden temperature drop came hand in hand with it, but it was something she didn’t mind. Yet, because Elsa left home unprepared, she found herself among one of the many naive people who fell victim to another one of heaven’s mood swings.\n\t\nElsa’s pace quickened as she internally decided between rushing home or taking a detour to one of the many cafés on the busy street.\nIt wasn’t long before her monologue decided on the latter.\nA mocha latte would do the trick. She grinned to herself, ecstatic at the idea of spending the noon reading, her idea of unwinding, at an unsuspecting café. \n\nDumped at the core of the astir Manhattan, Elsa encountered no shortage of coffee shops, but because of the rain’s sudden intrusion, her idea to avoid it was proven unauthentic. \nApparently, three Starbucks placed strategically on the same street isn’t enough to satisfy the commuters on their tramp home from work.\nShe sighed to herself, huffing out a cloud that dissipated into the atmosphere almost as quickly as it came, leaving little time for awe. \n\nLosing not much but just a little bit of hope— and patience, Elsa rounded the corner onto a different street.\nScanning the area, she noticed two more cafés, maybe four if bubble tea shops count. But upon looking through the translucent windows, her shoulders drooped. They too seem to be packed with people who too had hoped to avoid the growing downpour outside. \n\tElsa’s mood dampened with her clothes and hair, but she nevertheless surveyed the street one more time, convinced that this umpteenth time would be her final. \n\tIt must’ve been the water that got in her eye causing her to squint, but she swore that single droplet was a godsend. \n\tThanks to the sneaky little rascal, she noticed a small, narrow coffee shop wedged between another Starbucks and a Half & Half. Unlike its two neighbors, it didn’t have a ‘see-through window’ to flaunt its interior and lure in giddy customers.\nThe average person wouldn’t even have suspected the narrow store to be a coffee shop— much less notice it. And to the select few who thought to look just slightly above them, they would’ve been greeted with a wooden sign hanging out to the street, perpendicular to the store. Then, they would have an option between the no-named bistro or the two major franchises that sandwich it. \nA normal person would go with the latter options— after all, they’re major franchises for a reason. \n\t\nElsa was under the ‘average person’ category because, if it wasn’t for the droplet, she would’ve for sure missed it. \nBut she was in no way a ‘normal person’. Major franchises be damned if it means she finally has a haven from the rain and a place to enjoy her book in, which was waiting for her safely in the covert of her bag. \n\nRing.\nThe golden bell, perched at the top of the café entrance, chimed, signaling Elsa’s arrival. \n\n\nJack’s POV\n\tAnd… done!\nJackson stepped exactly four feet away from the wall to admire his handiwork. An additional step and his back would’ve been tickled with the numerous antennas reaching out of the clay pot, meant to keep the rowdy vines in check. But a step shorter and his peripheral would just miss the tip of the paper-mâché’d top hat, the crown of his work.\nHis thin lips curved into a dainty smile as he basked in the presence of his latest exploit meant to pass time.\n\nA 3D armadillo, made up of an array of yellow and brown, quite literally popped out of his otherwise dull drawing of the night sky, its wide torso covering up more than half the painting. As if that wasn’t arbitrary enough, two giant sculpted palms, complementary with fingers, accompanied the animal to complete the ‘look’ Jack had in mind. \nBut what the artist was most proud of was not the round-spectacles nested on the armadillo’s nose or the blue and yellow origami butterflies he somehow managed to stick on. Despite being responsible for knotting the whole ordeal together, the pair’s efforts went unnoticed. \nNope. It wasn’t them.\n\tInstead, the reason for Jack’s giddiness came from the top hat, nested between the armadillo’s cardboard ears.\n\tThe hat was ornamented with vibrant-hued knick-knacks that would have alternatively laid around his store, attracting dust. Hues that would otherwise have no place in his work— if Jack gave a damn about presentability. \nBordered with an intricately patterned gold frame, salvaged from god knows where, his apparition was fulfilled. \nHe couldn’t help but feel inflated at his… painting? Sculpture? Painting sculpture? Work of art. \nHe had used up hours— that would’ve ended up wasted regardless, on said ‘work of art.’ \n\nThe proposal to name it, so it doesn’t have to be referred to as just ‘work of art’, came to him, only to end up being shooed away. \nJack was in no way a ponderer. The idea of over analyzing, even the smallest of things, and the need to have a reason for this and a reason for that turned him off.\nHypothetically, if he were to be asked to explain what his work meant, much less name it, he would be incapable of supplying a satisfactory answer. \n\n“Sandy. Pitch.” Jack called to the abnormal chess-playing duo on the other side of his store. \n“What do you think of this work of art?” \nUpon the voice’s summon, Pitch and Sandy looked up from their intimate game, their attention now on Jack and his ‘work of art’. \nSandy, a bright, short, and chubby man with rowley blonde hair, gave him a hesitative nod, supported with two thumbs up.\nPitch, the complete opposite of his dedicated chess opponent, a tall, dull man, sporting spiky black hair, with ghostly— but still human-like skin, looked at Jack quizzically.\n“That is what you consider a ‘work of art’?”\nOn cue with his emphasis, he raised his long, lanky fingers, turning them into a pair of quotation marks to further mock Jack’s name for it.\nJack chuckled in amusement. “Well, if you really think about it, anything can be considered a work of art, y’know.”\n“Some more than others.” Pitch grumbled as he turned his conscience back to the board and its pieces, where Sandy patiently awaited his next move.\n\n\tJack turned away from his most loyal customers and smiled, leaving them unperturbed once again.\n\nWith his creative hunger pleased, he decided to do his job.\n\tHumming in content, he took out trimmers from his apron pocket and turned to the vines awaiting him. They’ve been neglected for long enough. \n\nRing.\nJack was indifferent to the chime. 99% of the time, visitors who play the bell have been here before, accustomed to their way around. \n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Back here!” Jackson yelled over the variety of plants and flowers that flocked the entrance. \nIt seems like this instance was the 1%.\n\n<>\n\t\n“I’m sorry, am I...” the voice grew louder, giving Jack the assumption she rounded the corner, closing in on him.\n\t“...in the right place?” she finished her question, now right in front of the boy. \n\n\tJack’s eyes dilated, showing off his cornflower blue irises. \n\tSnip. He accidentally cut off an extra inch or two from the ill-fated vine. \n\tHe didn’t care. Plants can grow back.\n\tOn the other hand, he’d never seen a girl as, for lack of words, beautiful as the one standing before him.\nPeople who say beauty is on the inside are dirty, filthy liars— that, or they just haven’t, unfortunately, been blessed with this girl in their presence yet. \n\t\n\tClosing his slightly agape mouth, Jack picked up his composure before she suspects he’s a weird man.\n\t“Describe ‘right place’”, he responded, imitating Pitch’s ‘quotation mark fingers’ from before. \n\t“Well, I was hoping this might be a coffee shop.”\n\tElsa looked around, slightly intrigued— but disgusted at all the random pots of plants and vines hanging from the ceiling and the assortment of paintings and pictures on the wall. It seemed to her that they were just hung up with no mind as to how they might fit and look next to each other, that they were just busybodies meant to occupy the space. \nMore pots, housing all kinds of colorful and diverse species of plants, were sitting with random trinkets— some she’d never even seen before, on the floor, counters, and, occasionally, tables, making the place seem smaller than it already was.\n\t“But it looks more like a… flower shop?” she guessed.\n\tJack let out a light laugh at her uncertainty.\n\t“Well, both your guesses are right. This place is a flower shop and a bistro.” Jack assured her.\n\tShe looked unconvinced at the latter.\n\tHaving no verbal way to convince her, he beckoned, “Here, follow me. The counter’s at the back.” \n\tDesperate for shelter from the growing torrential downpour outside, she followed.\n\n\t“Welcome to Wonder-land, what can I treat the missus to today?” Jack flashed his signature, charming smile at the girl over the coffee counter, the only normal thing in this store.\n\tNeglecting his efforts to woo her, her eyes glued itself to the hand-written menu hanging behind him. \n\t“I’ll have a small iced mocha latté,” she requested.\n\tJack snorted at her request. \n\t“Really? I thought you would be a tea kind of person.” \n\tElsa looked unfazed, deliberately ignoring his slightly rude assumption.\n\tCatching onto her displeasure, Jack scrambled to ease it. “For here or to go?”\n\t“For here,” she answered as she took out her wallet and handed him a five. “Keep the change.”\n\tJack couldn’t help but smile at her answer. “Alright, you can have a seat at any of the open tables in this store and I’ll bring your drink over— when it’s done of course.”\n\tShe turned to leave.\n\t“Oh yeah,” Jack called out to her. “Here.”\n\tHe handed her a single daisy.\n\t“It’s for first-time customers,” he told her, reassuring her skepticism.\n\tNot seeing the need to verbally respond, she dipped her head lightly to thank him and turned to an empty table near the window, she had noticed on her way in.\n\t\n\tIn a good mood, she gracefully tucked the flower between one of the knots in her loose french braid, resting lazily on her shoulder. \nThe usually regal girl couldn’t contain her growing smile as she sat down, having finally found a place to enjoy her book in.\n\tThe seat was rather comfy so she had no problem adjusting to it. Five seconds in, she was already engulfed in her book. \nThe condition of this store and the slightly annoying barista no longer accompanied a place in her mind. \n\n\t“Here, an iced mocha latté for the pretty missus.” Jack bent over.\nHe proceeded to delicately place her cup on the low, circular table.\n“Whew, it’s not everyday you see someone reading a dictionary.” He whistled.\n\tCrack.\n\tElsa’s perfect fantasy shattered, along with the little amount of patience she had. After a long day of classes, an unannounced downpour, a struggle to find a place to shelter in, resulting in her discomfited state because of her damp hair and clothes, Elsa felt like shit.\n\tAnd all it took was an overly cocky and annoying barista to push her off the edge of the already cracking ice.\n\t“It’s not everyday you encounter a flower-coffee, whatever shop, only to meet an overly-nosy, rude, infuriating, and overall annoying barista who can’t keep his pretty little head to himself.” she shot back, discarding whatever amount of regality she had left.\n\tTaken aback by her sudden outburst, Jack instinctively stepped back, using the tray that assisted him, to shield himself. \n\tEven Pitch and Sandy, who were sitting across the room from her, turned. \n\tElsa gasped as her brain worked to keep up and process what she had just said to the poor, unknowing barista. \n\tHer icy orbs widened in alarm.\n\t“I-I’m so very sorry for what I just said. I-I know making excuses is insincere, b-but today was an off-day for me and I—” she fumbled her words, trying to apologize and explain herself to the recipient of her indecency. \n\tJack blinked at the flabbergasted girl in front of him. She was no longer the noble girl he had just met, tripping on all the words she managed to get out of her quivering lips.\n\tJack laughed a loud, crude laugh, tears forming on the edges of his eyes.\n\tPitch rolled his eyes at Jack and Sandy smiled, once again, resuming their silent game of chess.\n\t\nRecovering from his fit of laughter, he smiled.\n\t“It’s alright.” he wiped his tears.\n\t“But—” she started.\n\t“It’s really alright.” he interrupted her.\n\t“I’m really sorry. Is there any way I can make it up to you?” she retaliated, guilt still very much present in her pleading eyes.\n\t“Hmm… if you insist…” Jack started, right hand on his chin, fake-contemplating. “Chat with me. At least for five minutes.”\n\tElsa hesitated.\n\t“But don’t you have work to do?” she asked him, trying to rid herself of the predicament she got herself into.\n\tJack chuckled at her, catching on to her ulterior motive.\n\t“Like what?”\n\t“Uh…”, she looked around. “Cleaning?”\n\tJack wiped his fingertip on one one of the nearby counters topped with a few pots of plants.\n\t“Spotless.” He showed her his dust-less finger. \n\t“What about the vines. Weren’t you in the middle of trimming them before I interrupted you?” she pursued.\n\t“Been there, done that.” He hummed lazily.\n\t\n\tFinding herself with no other choice but to accept his proposal to a five minute conversation, she surrendered.\n\t“Alright, five minutes.” She sighed defeatedly.\n\tJack grinned as he took the seat across from her, internally celebrating his triumph over her stubbornness.\n\t\nAfraid to waste the time he was generously given, he bombarded the poor girl with questions right away.\n“May I have your name?”\nShe looked up from her book and looked at him.\n“Usually, I don’t give my name to people whom I just met 10 minutes ago.” she got back to her book.\n“Well, without a name I’m afraid I’ll have to resort to calling you missus for the next five minutes,” Jack sighed dejectedly slumping down into his chair.\nElsa’s attention shot back to him.\n“Elsa. It’s Elsa.”\nJack’s facade faded, cheering up over something as simple as a name.\n“Elsa. A name fit for the pretty missus,” he awed at her name. “I’m Jackson by the way, but you can call me Jack.”\nShe nodded, acknowledging what he said, too bothered to respond.\n“So… Elsa.” Jack sought to continue their conversation.\n“Why a dictionary? And why are you so into reading a dictionary,” he put emphasis on ‘dictionary’ twice. \nWithout putting the book down, she responded lightly, “because Jack, a dictionary is educational.”\nJack guffawed. He couldn’t process why people would voluntarily read, much less read to learn.\nElsa sighed and elaborated, “don’t you find yourself lacking the right word to use sometimes?”\nJack shrugged, “Not really, not everything needs words to explain it with.”\n“Plus, even if I did lack the right words, reading a dictionary is not worth it,” he had emphasized the word ‘dictionary’ three times now.\nShe glared at him, unamused. At this point, she figured mockery is a habit of his and there’s no use in losing her demeanor over it— again.\n“It’s also to keep nosy, white-haired baristas away,” she added smugly.\n“Or, it can be a great conversation starter,” Jack added on to her claim with his own. “And mine’s actually proven too.”\nShe rolled her eyes, “I’ve only read a dictionary in public once, it’s best not to draw conclusions yet.”\n“Also, I think I look good in white hair. It really makes my eyes pop.” Jack added as he remembered her comment about his hair color. “Plus, your hair is not much darker than mine.”\n“At least it’s natural,” she muttered, head returning to her book.\nJack laughed, eyeing her dictionary.\n“I mean, words are cool and all but I like to express my thoughts through art,” he revived their dictionary topic, realizing his last comment unknowingly pulled her string— again. \nHe smirked, “In fact, this whole shop is filled with my art.”\nAfraid to lose Elsa’s attention to the dictionary, settled in her hand, once more, Jack pointed out his latest ‘work of art.’ \n“See that?” he smiled proudly. “That’s the newest piece to my collection.”\nElsa turned to the direction his finger was pointing. \n“Eh… that looks… nice…?” she stared at it, wondering what— and why it was.\nJack couldn’t help but snicker at her speechlessness, surprised that her vocabulary still included basic words like ‘nice’ and words that aren’t even real words like ‘eh’.\nShe turned back to him, a sudden trace of curiosity crept its way on her face.\n“I’ve been wondering, why is this place so discreet? I didn’t even notice there was a window that faces the street.” Elsa questioned, motioning her head to the window on her right.\n“Well, the window is tinted from the outside. But from the inside, we can see everything out there clearly,” Jack answered, motioning his head to the other side of the window.\n“But why? Shouldn’t it be clear from the outside to, you know, attract customers? Even in the rain, this place is… empty.” She looked around, confirming the latter.\n“Well, first off, we’re financially stable thanks to our loyal customers,” Jack replied, beckoning to Sandy and Pitch. “And even though we don’t make nearly as much as our neighbors, I’d have it no other way.”\nJack leaned back in his chair, one leg crossed over the other, and hands over his head, forming a makeshift pillow.\nHis lidded eyes completed the look.\n“Besides, thanks to my artistic abilities, it’s like our own little world in here, away from one of the busiest cities in the world,” he continued, opening one of his eyes to look at Elsa.\n\nElsa looked around, cautiously taking in the sight of the small store surrounding her once more. \nHe was right. Although it might look irregular at the first inspection, she realized that every odd trinket and their complementary place in the shop was intentional.\nShe couldn't help but draw similarities between the ‘flower-coffee shop’ and the taverns and greenhouses she envisioned so many times before, when submerged in a good fantasy book, full of wizards, knights, princes, and queens.\nThe place felt magical— even without the magic, much like a… Wonderland. \nShe smiled to herself. It really was a different world from the one just over the window.\n\n“You really thought it all out, didn’t you—? The interior and design of this place I mean,” she asked Jack, admiration clearly painted on her face.\n Jack blinked.\n“Uh, no not really,” he confessed. “I just went with my gut.”\n“But if I had to lie to sway you, then yes, all of this took hours of thinking to come up with,” he smirked, fist lightly tapping his head.\nShe rolled her eyes.\n“How did you even get the owner to let you put up all the…” she contemplated on the right word to finish her question with.\n“Works of art?”\nJack laughed at her.\n“I don’t need approval. I’m the owner.”\nElsa’s eyes widened in surprise.\n“You? But you don’t look older than 18.”\n“I’m offended,” Jack faked a sob. “I’ll have you know I’m 21, I’m legal.”\nShe rolled her eyes— again at the last part.\n“Okay, but aren’t you also a college student?’ she started.\n“Most people opt to go to college nowadays,” she added, making sure he knows that her question was out of pure curiosity and had no rude intentions.\n“Nope, after graduating high school, I chose to open this store with the help of my family and friends.” Jack smiled, recalling the support he’d received from those close to him. “And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”\n“What about you? How old are you? I’m assuming you’re still in school?” He directed the subject of conversation to her.\n“I’m 22. And yeah, a business major.” \nJack smiled for the hundredth time that day, soreness creeping on his cheeks. “Well that explains why you were wondering about the lack of customers and our profits.”\n“I guess so. It’s in our best interests,” she flushed slightly, embarrassed at her intruding question just a few minutes ago.\n\nA comfortable silence befell the two as Elsa found her way back to the book in her hand, and as Jack turned his focus to the world on the other side of the window. Priorly lost in each other’s company, they hadn’t noticed the rain outside had begun to pour down harder. \n\nJack looked outside and grimaced. “It’s gonna be awhile till the rain stops.”\nElsa nodded glumly.\n“I noticed you ordered an iced latté, does the cold weather not bother you?” Jack strived to continue their pleasant conversation from before, refusing to sit in silence with the girl, who, unbeknownst to herself, gained more and more of his affection.\n“Nope, I like the cold. Not the rain, but the cold.”\nJack eagerly looked at her, “I agree, the cold is awesome. And a snow day would make it more awesome.”\n“Yes, a snow-day would be nice!” Elsa excitedly replied, thinking back to the snow days she’d experienced and how she had all but positive memories of them.\nJack couldn’t help but soften at her newfound giddiness. \n“I wouldn’t be surprised if you were the Snow Queen in your past life.”\n“And I wouldn’t be surprised if you turned out to be the reincarnation of the Winter Spirit, Jack Frost,” she rebutted his joke with her own.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised either.” Jack chuckled. “But I bet he wouldn’t have been able to grow flowers, y’know, with his powers and all.”\nHis mention of flowers re-ignited Elsa’s curiosity, reminding her of an inquiry that slipped her mind.\n“Say, why flower shop? I mean it could’ve been anything else, so why a flower shop?”\nAt her question, Jack found himself pondering for the first time in a long while. \n“So,” he started, his hand reaching into his pocket to retrieve something, fighting to resist a smile\nHe leaned over the table, towards Elsa.\n“I can put another flower in your hair,” he teased, flashing his signature lopsided smirk as his hands work to carefully secure the flower in her platinum-blonde locks.\nHe retreated back to his seat, “Now, you look even more beautiful with two flowers in your hair!”\nJack’s cheeks were tinted red, but nowhere as near as Elsa’s hue of dangerously bright pink.\n“W-Was that your way of f-flirting with me?” she squeaked incredulously, choking on her words.\nCute. Jack thought.\n\n“You know, Elsa, you ask quite a lot of questions,” Jack stood up, laughing.\n“Considering you only had five minutes,” he winked.\nAt that remark, Elsa’s recovery was in vain because her face tinged a brighter shade.\nShe groaned, bringing her book up to shield her vulnerable face from the conniving barista, but at the same time, trying to hide her disappointment at his departure.\n\nHe may or he may not have noticed her crestfallen face, but as if on cue, he reached down to grab her empty cup.\n“I’ll be back with your refill and my own iced drink,” he said between grins.\nTo his words, Elsa lightened up.\n“Alright,” she responded passively, hiding her elation. “I look forward to your return.”\n“Keep talking like that and I won’t return,” Jack teased, poking fun at her professional manner of talking.\nHmph. Elsa huffed and fake-pouted at his mockery. \n“Be back in a jiffy,” he reassured her, walking back to the counter.\n\nElsa sat in quietness, left to savor Pitch’s tapping and Sandy’s tranquil humming. \n\tShe turned to the window.\n\tThe rain was no more. And the once almost empty Manhattan streets were livened with a fresh set of scrambling commuters, eager to head home from their evening shift.\nBut despite the cloud’s parting and the comeback of the sun’s awaited rays, she allowed herself to continue sitting in her sequestered world, anticipating Jack’s return. \n\nSmiling in content, she surrendered her book back to her bag, her hands ridded of the companion for the first time that afternoon. \n\n"

{"text": "Nights like these were his favorite: when the air was crisp and sharp—even for someone whose lungs didn’t work— when the temperature was cool enough for a blue hoodie and bare feet, when the sky was without a single cloud in sight—when the earth was laid bare and naked to the heavens above.\n\nNights like these remind him of Arendelle.\n\nThe Guardian of Fun smiled to himself as he drew the connection between Burgess and Arendelle. Hell, did everything remind him of Arendelle? Yes, yes they did.\n\nWell for a good reason he supposed. Actually, it’s hard to not compare—which was a bit unfair really as Arendelle would always reign above all. He smirked as he reminds himself of the reason why. He should probably get his responsibilities over with if he missed said kingdom this much. If he missed her this much.\n\nHe wanted to see her again.\n\nAs the wind took him for a ride around Burgess, assisting him in his duty of bringing snow days to the unsuspecting people below, Jack Frost wondered to himself: Does she miss him the way he misses her?\n\nHe fucking hopes so—and maybe— just maybe, he would like to claim he knows so. But as powerful as the Guardians of Childhood are, their magic is oh so limited. So try as he might, he’ll never really know for sure what Elsa was thinking—and the closest he’ll ever get is when she wears her heart on her sleeves (which was rare in itself, especially as she got older). But… with or without the power to know what she’s thinking, he thinks it was never safer to assume she did—that she had in fact missed him. \n\nHe might even dare say she loves him.\n\nJack’s heart smiled at the thought, somersaulting with joy inside his ribcage like him in the wind’s grasp.\n\nBut the logic that resides deep within him thought otherwise. Please, you’re not even together that way. Jack’s face soured.\n\nBeing optimistic was good and all, but, at least retain some form of reason. And maybe then, the fall won’t hurt as much if it’s expected… if your hopes weren’t that high-achieving, to begin with.\n\nJack Frost bit the inside of his lip grimly. Was that blood he tasted? Who ever knows for sure? And he wasn’t willing to find out.\n\n~~~\n\nJack Frost wasn’t much of a thinker (and he was never really a doer either). He went where the wind takes him. Wherever the wind thought fit to bring him next, he obliged without a question. But tonight, he felt the need to stray from the wind’s will, he wanted to confront someone about something—about the weird, ever-growing feeling in his non-beating heart.\n\nSo for the first time in a long while, Jack Frost pondered. And he had used the whole fly to Arendelle to do it.\n\nHe’d known Elsa for well over 12 years now. Since she was around 5 years old or so. He knew just how much she’d been through— after all— he was right beside her for the whole of it, no? Maybe that was why she still believed in him, why she could still see him. He would be lying to himself—and to the rest of the world— if he said he didn’t fear the idea of her not ever being to see him again, of how, one day, she would walk right through the ghost of him. But after many late-night talks and deep, life-questioning conversations, he came to believe—to hope— that that wouldn’t happen. \n\nThat, unlike Jamie, Elsa was different. She wasn’t a special case. She wasn’t… but she went ahead and became one. \n\nAnd she had years over Jamie to prove it. \n\nAt first, it was just a friendship. A very, real and raw friendship. Between two people who are so alike yet so different in their many many unique ways—in ways, the rest of the world could only ever hope to understand. But years later, when Elsa neared his age, he couldn’t help but wonder. \n\nElsa was beautiful. She was never not so. He knew it. But it just took him a tad bit longer to realize that the new unknowing feeling in his frozen heart was love. \n\nAttraction is a very weird thing indeed but hey, can you really blame him? For being eternally 17? No, no you cannot. It wasn’t that way at first, and it wasn’t his fault Elsa was growing.\n\n~~~\n\nJack’s flight was nearing an end as he can see the familiar silhouette of Arendelle castle in the far distance. Like Burgess, the night was clear, rendering him bare to the stars above, to the moon, to Manny. He growled to himself as his mind passed over the thought of Manny. \n\n\nDoes he know of Jack’s intentions to confess tonight? Jack sure hopes not. But it wouldn’t be a very Manny thing to not know. (And why did the word ‘confess’ feel so weird? Or was it the idea of it? Maybe confrontation was the better term.)\n\nAs he neared his destination, his heart got all the more closer to his throat, clawing its way out. Save me from the embarrassment. It screams. \n\nJack couldn’t agree more. Where was this heightened level of confidence coming from? Had Sandy done something to mess with his subconscious again? \n\nBut he knew the answer deep down. Asking useless questions was just a way of coping. His selfish self wasn’t okay with the idea of what he already is to Elsa, he wanted to be something more, more than what he already is to her: a guardian and a (best) friend. And unless the quick (un)secretive glances, the not pulling away from physical touch, the closer-than-personal-space-close interactions, and the shared looks of fondness were something just friends did, then his success rate tonight was high—if he does say so himself. \n\nAnd then he was finally here. \n\nHe picked up his heart as he sighed for the last time that night before stepping into her window, open as it waits for him. \n\nHis mind runs over the rehearsal of his intended words once more. Maybe if he willed it hard enough, his feelings would be reciprocated.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n“I love you. \n\nSo please say you love me too.”\n"
