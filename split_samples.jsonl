{"text": "\u201cNicholas, I know\u2014I know it\u2019s been hard for you."}

{"text": "He tries anyway, \u201cEverything."}
{"text": "It\u2019s everything, Callie."}
{"text": "So many things, so many things are going wrong\u2014and I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d he fails to stop the crack in his voice."}

{"text": "Only she can string her words together like that, and only she can be right when it comes to him."}
{"text": "He realizes he can\u2019t remember the last time he thought about Oliver\u2019s death without the added task of comforting someone else\u2014or what he really did to cope with it."}
{"text": "Or if he ever tried."}
{"text": "Neither of them say anything anymore, but she stops eating her dinner and walks over to hug him."}
{"text": "He lets her."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He lets her tire out the syllables of the mantra."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He lets her pretend to understand half of what he\u2019s going through and pushes down the thought that it's her job, as his girlfriend, to say stuff like that."}
{"text": "\u201cNicholas!\u201d\nHe turns to the direction of the voice."}
{"text": "\u201cNicholas!"}
{"text": "Wait please.\u201d A boy."}
{"text": "A boy around his age, \u2014younger maybe."}
{"text": "When he sees that he stopped for him, he runs the last few steps."}
{"text": "\u201cHello,\u201d he says, a little in awe and starstruck."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m wondering if Miryan, Ambur, and you can help me with something\u2026\u201d he stalls."}
{"text": "Nicholas doesn\u2019t say anything as he digs his hands deeper into his coat pockets and buries his face further into his scarf."}
{"text": "He\u2019s uncomfortable with where this conversation is going."}
{"text": "He has a hunch, \u2014and honestly\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to be right."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m wondering if you guys c-can\u2026\u201d The boy chokes on his next words, and Nicholas notices\u2014recognizes\u2014that look on his face."}
{"text": "Anything, he prays."}
{"text": "\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s been missing for a couple of weeks now."}

{"text": "No, it doesn\u2019t."}
{"text": "The Berlin incident is unrelated to this case.\u201d\nAnd he wants to punch himself for ever feeling relief at that."}
{"text": "Bring it to the police."}
{"text": "We aren\u2019t meant for cases like this."}
{"text": "We\u2019re so much more than missing persons and murder mysteries."}
{"text": "His mind walks through all the things he wants to say."}
{"text": "It\u2019s been a month., Your sister\u2019s probably dead."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll see what I\u2014what we\u2014can do for you,\u201d he says without really meaning it."}
{"text": "The boy thanks him and hands him a note with what must\u2019ve been his scribbled number."}
{"text": "Nicholas takes it and returns his smile, then bids him farewell."}
{"text": "He watches the boy walk away; one, two, a dozen cars pass, but he\u2019s still there, eyes tunneled to the spot where the boy once stood."}
{"text": "He crumbles the note in his hand, and his mind wonders when, exactly, did his identity become a chore."}
{"text": "His conscience stops him from tossing it."}
{"text": "The next time he sees the both of them again after the funeral is at a meeting with important people."}
{"text": "He should at least know said important peoples\u2019 names, but making lasting first impressions lost its appeal a little while ago."}
{"text": "To be honest, he\u2019s starting to forget where he is and why he\u2019s even here."}
{"text": "\u201cSo, it\u2019s been a month since the Berlin incident,\u201d the wide man at the end of the long, rectangular wooden table starts."}
{"text": "He looks up across at the three of them but Nicholas knows it's only at him, \u201cAny progress on tracking the ones that are hiding among us?\u201d\nHe looks down at the notepad in front of him and answers, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAny progress at all?\u201d the man\u2019s moppy brows are raised now."}
{"text": "\u201cNone, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, I\u2019m a little disappointed in you, Nicholas.\u201d\n\u201cI understand, sir.,\u201d He shifts in his seat."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd I apologize for our lack of progress., We\u2019ll be better."}
{"text": "I promise.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, boy,\u201d the man replies with his fingers crossed."}
{"text": "\u201cI have great expectations\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay.\u201d\nEveryone, including him, turns to the sound of the voice."}

{"text": "\u201cThe aliens are out there right now; , they\u2019re out there doing god knows what, and these three haven't done a single damn thing.,\u201d a complain."}
{"text": "\u201c Heck, why are you even gifted with such powers if you\u2019re going to be lazy and selfish?"}
{"text": "It would\u2019ve been better off with anyone else,\u201d an attack."}
{"text": "He swallows the lump in his throat and keeps his eye contact with the woman."}
{"text": "They\u2019re in a room with at least two dozen others, all crowded into some old room of some old historically significant building, but it feels like they\u2019re the only ones there."}

{"text": "\u201cMs."}
{"text": "Avery, please, they\u2019re just kids\u2014\u201d the man at the center starts."}
{"text": "A loud slam from his right and every head turns from the woman to her."}
{"text": "\u201cYou want them?"}
{"text": "!\u201d It's Miry\u2019s turn now."}
{"text": "\u201cCause I\u2019d be better off without them too.\u201d\nShe\u2019s laughing, and he knows it\u2019s to keep herself from crying."}
{"text": "But even if she does, he can\u2019t blame her, because he kind of wants to, too."}
{"text": "\u201cYou think you can do our job?!"}
{"text": "Have at it!"}
{"text": "Take it, I\u2019ll give you my powers if I can.\u201d \n\u201cMiry, stop,\u201d Ambur begs her."}
{"text": "\u201cPlease."}
{"text": "Not here, not now.\u201d\nHe turns to Nicholas for help, but like him, he doesn\u2019t know how to."}
{"text": "She\u2019s charting into degeneracy, and he doesn\u2019t know what to say or do to bring her back, so as her leader, he lets her continue:\n\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to live your life in paranoia?"}

{"text": "Ambur\u2019s fighting for his attention\u2014he\u2019s trying to get him to stop her, but he\u2019s caught on a thought: Does he even want to?"}
{"text": "\u201cHave you ever attended a stranger\u2019s funeral?"}
{"text": "Seen a dead body?"}
{"text": "What about the blown-out brain or organs of someone?"}
{"text": "What about walking through them and stepping on them because you have no other choice?\u201d\nHis eyes find their way back to the notepad and it feels like he\u2019s burning a hole in it."}
{"text": "He sits there."}
{"text": "He sits there and ignores all the pairs of eyes begging him to do something and he pretends he isn\u2019t paying attention to any of them as he takes her all in."}
{"text": "He takes her all in and he lets her lay down all the ugly truths."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you know what it feels like to be burdened with the world\u2019s fate?"}
{"text": "To devote yourself to its future\u2026\u201d she pauses."}

{"text": "Nicholas can tell he\u2019s getting restless; he looks like he\u2019s about to throw up\u2014and honestly, any more and he may have."}
{"text": "And Nicholas gets it."}
{"text": "He gets that now isn\u2019t the time and that this isn\u2019t the place, and he knows every goddamn world leader in this stuffy room is judging her and judging him for not stopping her\u2014and even though no one really says anything, he can tell from the way they look at him."}
{"text": "\u201cOnly to question every day whether it\u2019s even worth it."}
{"text": "But you still have to\u2026 because that\u2019s what heroes do."}

{"text": "And there it was."}
{"text": "The truth he spent the entirety of his life denying, the truth he already knows anyway."}
{"text": "The difference is, he can\u2019t say it."}
{"text": "As their leader and as the very best of them, he just can\u2019t."}
{"text": "He isn\u2019t allowed to."}
{"text": "Because admitting to it would betray the very definition of what a superhero is."}
{"text": "For the sake of the world, he can\u2019t say no simply just because and just because he doesn\u2019t really want to."}

{"text": "But despite the look she gave him, she decided it would be a good idea to finish the rest of her stroll besides him."}
{"text": "After all, it wasn\u2019t everyday you find a fellow god on human lands, much less when and where the glaze lilies were blooming."}
{"text": "This was definitely a sign."}
{"text": "She grabbed parts of her robes and pulled them up lightly, ensuring she wasn\u2019t harming them anywhere, and jogged up to him."}
{"text": "Upon her appearance at his side, he eyed her, raising his left eyebrow, giving her a most suspicious look."}
{"text": "A look Guizhong ignored."}
{"text": "\u201cSo\u2026\u201d she started, trying to ease the tension."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat are you doing on mortal lands?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAwe, come on, there must be a reason as to why you\u2019re down here,\u201d she whined at his lame answer."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve been down here many, many, times and not once have I encountered another deity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmph,\u201d he glanced at her, keeping his head forward."}
{"text": "\u201cEven if I did have a reason, I do not have a reason to share it with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, alright.\u201d she lowered her head defeatedly."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry I cared and asked.\u201d\n\nMorax\u2019s attention is now fully on the road they were walking whilst Guizhong\u2019s was at the ground beneath her and the flower in her hand."}
{"text": "The awkwardness was killing her."}
{"text": "She didn\u2019t know how to keep a conversation with someone as boring and dull as Morax."}
{"text": "Why did she even decide to join him in the first place?"}
{"text": "She racked her brain over and over at the rash decision to run up to and walk alongside him."}
{"text": "\u201cIt would be best if you stopped wearing your heart on your sleeve.\u201d\n\nAs luck would have it, she did not need to break the silence."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd what\u2019s the matter with that?\u201d she inquired looking up from the ground, fixing her posture at the same time."}
{"text": "\u201cEverything."}
{"text": "Maybe coming down here so often negatively impacted you,\u201d Morax continued."}
{"text": "\u201cAlas, there must be a reason as to why you don\u2019t see anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do know that \u2018everything\u2019 doesn\u2019t answer anything, right?\u201d she remarked, slowly losing her patience."}
{"text": "Haa."}
{"text": "Another sigh elicited from the tall man."}
{"text": "\u201cHarboring human emotions will do you no benefit."}
{"text": "Nor coming all the way here, unless there is a good enough reason,\u201d he explained."}
{"text": "She eyed him victoriously."}
{"text": "\u201cSo you do have a reason.\u201d\n\nMorax guffawed at her ignoring his main point altogether."}
{"text": "\u201cThat was not my point.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d she smiled, turning back to the road, happy to have dodged his judgemental comment with her sly one."}
{"text": "They once again fell into silence."}
{"text": "However, Guizhong thought it wasn\u2019t so awkward this time."}
{"text": "After all, it is only awkward if she makes it awkward."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, she decided to speak up again, \u201cSo Morax, tell me about yourself.\u201d\n\nTo her sudden inquiry, he turned to her hesitantly."}
{"text": "Upon looking at her face, he was greeted with a solemn, yet sincere, smile."}
{"text": "One that showed her eagerness to hearing his story, no traces of a possible rejection in it."}
{"text": "Drawn to the serenity, he couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth."}
{"text": "~~~~~\n\nShe had listen to him intently, making sure to not miss a single word from the Geo Archon."}
{"text": "As his story was coming to a close, so did their stroll together."}
{"text": "\u201cSay, since I have done all the talking, it is your turn.\u201d\n\nGuizhong chuckled."}
{"text": "\u201cMust I have to?"}
{"text": "Our journey together is nearing its end,\u201d she said as she looked down the road before them."}
{"text": "Morax followed the direction of her gaze."}
{"text": "\u201cNot quite yet."}
{"text": "There is still a good amount of steps left.\u201d\n\nShe hummed in agreement, \u201cwell what would you like to inquire about?\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, then at the flower still snuggled in her hand."}
{"text": "\u201cThe glaze lily, why are you so fond of them?"}
{"text": "They are most obviously the reason as to why you are down here, on this day and time.\u201d\n\nAs the steps required to finish the path they were on lowered, Guizhong thought deep and hard at Morax\u2019s question."}
{"text": "\u201cThere is no particular reason as to why I am this fond of them,\u201d she smiled looking down at the flower and giving it a subtle twirl."}
{"text": "\u201cBut if I were to give a reason, then it would be because it reminds me of humans,\u201d she looked up to meet his gaze."}
{"text": "At where they are, they can see the city coming into view, their journey together coming ever so closer to an end."}
{"text": "His gaze darkened at her naivety, most fondness he had found for her beginning to fade."}
{"text": "\u201cYou must think I\u2019m stupid for sympathizing with them,\u201d she started."}
{"text": "\"But those humans are as small and fragile as dust,\u201d she continued."}
{"text": "\"And because they are so small, they know not when they will lose their lives to disaster or strife, and so they are afraid.\""}
{"text": "\"And because they are afraid, they try harder to become more intelligent."}
{"text": "In a sense, they are like glaze lilies, fighting for survival amongst a cruel world,\" she said as her gaze shifted from flower to the city before them."}
{"text": "Then she turned back to him."}
{"text": "\u201cYou had asked me why I come down here as often as I do."}
{"text": "It is because I want to help those humans."}
{"text": "The same ones you presume are weak.\u201d\n\n\"And I thought that since there is such a gulf between us in strength, I should use technique and wisdom instead."}
{"text": "With your brawn and my brains, I\u2019m sure this city would surely become a great one,\u201c she finished in a hush and faced him with her most lovely, yet lonely, smile."}
{"text": "Morax\u2019s expression darkened."}
{"text": "\u201cGuizhong."}
{"text": "You know I can not.\u201d\nShe looked down and nodded solemnly."}
{"text": "\u201cIt was at least worth a shot,\u201d she hummed."}
{"text": "\u201cFor I can not achieve this alone.\u201d\n\nHe sympathetically looked at her, then to the flower in her hand, then to the village just across the shore from them."}
{"text": "He sighed in defeat."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2026\u201d he started."}
{"text": "\u201cI can assist you.\u201d\n\nHer head jolted, revealing her surprised expression at his sudden change in decision."}
{"text": "\u201cO-Only if you prove to me they are worthy of the Geo Archon\u2019s help.\u201d\n\nGuizhong was beaming at his earlier statement, his new one doing little to change her giddiness."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, I shall prove to you what they are capable of,\u201d she said excitedly as she took his hands in hers, squishing the flower between their palms."}
{"text": "Morax nodded, expressing his \u2018you\u2019re welcome.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a contract then,\u201d she beamed remembering his fondness of contracts when he told her about himself."}
{"text": "Morax flashed a light grin, \u201cIndeed."}
{"text": "Indeed it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, here!\u201d her eyes turned wide as she fumbled in her pockets and pulled out a stone dumbbell."}
{"text": "\u201cTake this!\u201d\n\nShe ushered Morax to open his hand so she could hand him said \u2018stone dumbbell\u2019."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is the mark of our pledge, and it is also my challenge to you.\u201d\n\nMorax looked at her in a most confused look, \u201cChallenge?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll my wisdom is hidden within this stone dumbbell,\u201d she answered."}
{"text": "\u201cIn exchange for helping me, you will acquire my wisdom.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is\u2026 only if you are able to unlock it,\u201d she smiled cheekily, glancing from him to the dumbbell, now in his hands."}
{"text": "\u201cHow is this a fair deal?\u201d he asked her amused, raising his left eyebrow."}
{"text": "\u201cIf your brain holds intellect, you should be able to open it."}
{"text": "And if you do, then I would be at the lower end of the deal."}
{"text": "It\u2019s more than fair, no?\u201d\n\nMorax did not have anything to say, so Guizhong took his silence as agreement to their contract."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, this journey has come to an end,\u201d Guizhong said as she looked over the marsh, night falling over them."}
{"text": "Mhm."}
{"text": "Morax hummed in agreement."}
{"text": "\u201cBut it won\u2019t be our last one together,\u201d she smiled as she looked back at him."}
{"text": "Mhm."}
{"text": "Morax hummed again in agreement."}
{"text": "\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nOn that day and at that place, when and where the glaze lilies were in abundant bloom, was also the day my life was permanently altered."}
{"text": "I think glaze lilies have also become something I am very fond of."}
{"text": "A lot of what you like has grown on me, not because of the reasons you like them for though, but because they all remind me of you."}
{"text": "Every time that fateful season comes around, when they are at their peak, I can\u2019t help but find my way back to Dihua Marsh."}
{"text": "Most of me wants to move on and leave you behind, but a part of me wants to be taken back to that time and place."}
{"text": "Back to when I saw you in a field of flowers."}
{"text": "\ud83c\udf3c 2."}
{"text": "The Memory of You\n\"Virtue grows tall like a tree, though there be shade it will flourish forever.\""}
{"text": "\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nThe second time I saw you was not as memorable as the first, but little did I know that that day would be one of the few I cherish."}
{"text": "Even after all these years, the memories have not left me, and I doubt it ever will."}
{"text": "Every so often, I can\u2019t help but reminisce back to then."}
{"text": "\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nMorax squinted as remnants of the sun fought through the cracks and openings of the very same item Guizhong had entrusted him with."}
{"text": "In the few days following his meeting with the God of Dust, he spent his waking hours trying to figure out the stone dumbbell and retrieve \u2018Guizhong\u2019s wisdom\u2019 as she had promised."}
{"text": "Being on the losing end of a contract did not sit well with the God of Contracts himself."}
{"text": "As one hand lifted up the item in question to the light, his other hand sat on the round stone tabletop, fingers tapping away in a synchronized rhythm."}
{"text": "How pointless."}
{"text": "Morax thought to himself as his fingers rotated the stone dumbbell, also dubbed \u2018puzzle\u2019 by Guizhong herself."}
{"text": "He did not go through the trouble of counting but it must\u2019ve been on the 100th rotation when he heard an all too familiar voice behind him."}
{"text": "\u201cMor\u2014 uh Zhongli!\u201d a feminine voice called out to the waiting adepti."}
{"text": "Morax had given Guizhong the name \u2018Zhongli\u2019, to be used when they were on mortal lands."}
{"text": "While doing so, he attempted to settle on one for Guizhong herself."}
{"text": "But to his suggestion, she told him that it was already too late for her to be using an alias."}
{"text": "A fact he deadpanned at."}
{"text": "\u201cZhongli!\u201d Guizhong called again as the distance between them closed."}
{"text": "\u201cMy apologies, did you wait for long?\u201d\n\nTo her inquiry, the sitting adepti looked up at her."}
{"text": "He showed her the puzzle, nestled between his thumb and his index fingers, giving it a little shake."}
{"text": "\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t that long a wait,\u201d he started."}
{"text": "\u201cBut any second tardier, and I would have decided to smash this dumbbell into the stone table.\u201d\n\nGuizhong rolled her eyes at her partner\u2019s remark."}
{"text": "\u201cSurely that would \u2018solve\u2019 it,\u201d she decided to play along with him, her fingers forming makeshift quotation marks to put emphasis on \u2018solve\u2019."}
{"text": "Zhongli nodded slightly from where he sat."}
{"text": "\u201cI am the brawns after all.\u201d\n\nHis reference to their conversation a few days back stifled a light chuckle from Guizhong."}
{"text": "\u201cAlright alright, you win,\u201d she said as she sat down on the stone stool just on the other side of him."}
{"text": "She shuffled around a bit on the stool before settling into a comfy enough position, both hands on the table in an upright stance to support her chin, and ultimately, her upper body, slightly leaning over the table."}
{"text": "Zhongli noted her posture could be better but decided against verbalizing his inner monologue."}
{"text": "\u201cSo how are you faring out with the puzzle?\u201d Guizhong asked, eyeing her possession in his hands."}
{"text": "He shrugged."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m convinced you had done something to rig it.\u201d\n\nHis suspicion uttered a loud laugh from Guizhong."}
{"text": "Her back contorted backwards, further terrorizing her already questionable posture, as her hands reached for her stomach, any elegance she had left trailing away from her."}
{"text": "\u201cNo, no I do not think I did,\u201d she started as her chimes died down."}
{"text": "Zhongli looked down at the puzzle still perched in his hand, patiently waiting to be solved."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, progress could be better.\u201d\n\nGuizhong left his response unattended as she, too, looked down at the stone dumbbell in his hands, boredly eyeing it."}
{"text": "\u201cEnough with trying to figure it out,\u201d she whined as she stood up from her stool, long hair draping over her shoulders."}
{"text": "\u201cHow about we get this day started and do what we had come to accomplish?\u201d\n\nThe feminine figure extended her hands towards Zhongli, who was still sitting, dumbbell in his hands."}
{"text": "He looked up at her and smiled, tucking the dumbbell away back into the confines of his dark robes, in contrast from Guizhong\u2019s light ones."}
{"text": "Despite his shift in attitude compared to their first encounter, he left her hand hanging, as with the first time."}
{"text": "But he nevertheless took the spot beside her as they walked away from the set of table and stools on the side of the road."}
{"text": "~~~\n\n\u201cHow are you planning to accomplish your goal today?\u201d Zhongli inquired as the sun\u2019s rays got all the more impenetrable, the effects of summer getting more and more obvious to him on mortal lands."}
{"text": "Guizhong beamed at his question."}
{"text": "Her hands found their way to pockets hidden inside the many layers of her robe, fumbling around for something."}
{"text": "\u201cAh!\u201d she made a sound of affirmation, moving her hands around, seemingly to confirm the item she found was indeed the right one."}
{"text": "\u201cHere!\u201d she said as she whipped the item out, her speed making Zhongli jump in surprise."}
{"text": "She held the parchment scroll horizontally, letting gravity do its job as the content unfolded itself."}
{"text": "The extended scroll\u2019s length reached past her waist from her chin."}
{"text": "Both adeptis halted in their tracks, Guizhong excitedly showing off her pride, Zhongli looking at her quizzically, convinced she\u2019s not as intelligent as they both thought she was."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is a list of what we are gonna do today!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want us to\u2026 to do all of that?\u201d Zhongli asked as he grimaced at the numerous lines stacked on top of each other."}
{"text": "It seemed Guizhong had utilized the parchment\u2019s full length."}
{"text": "\u201cWell I had a hard time fishing out the human\u2019s best qualities, so I wrote out all of them,\u201d Guizhong started as she angled the front of the parchment towards her so she could look over its contents."}
{"text": "\u201cAlthough it does look like a whole lot...\u201d she sighed as she stared at the parchment from top to bottom."}
{"text": "Her delicate fingers found its way to her chin, a gesture she often does when she is in deep thought, Zhongli noted."}
{"text": "\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to choose the best options from this extensive list,\u201d she reasoned."}
{"text": "\u201cThat is indeed quite the extensive list,\u201d he looked at her then to the sun, now directly above them, signalling high noon."}
{"text": "\u201cThe day is halfway over,\u201d his gaze found his way back to her."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you sure you can convince me?\u201d\n\nIn response to his challenge, she grinned and rolled the scroll back up."}
{"text": "\u201cEven if I did not have this,\u201d with the scroll now rolled back up to its original shape and in her hand, she elegantly tapped his nose with it, \u201cI think I will fare just fine.\u201d\n\nNow back on the dirt road, Guizhong started walking ahead, slightly faster than before to make up for their wasted time."}
{"text": "She turned back to the male figure, \u201cUnlike you with the stone dumbbell.\u201d\n\nAt the remark, Zhongli chuckled and walked to catch up to her, not finding the need to jog as his human legs were a whole few inches taller than hers."}
{"text": "~~~\n\nLaughter and chatter danced their way around the adepti pair as they entered the human city."}
{"text": "To Zhongli\u2019s left, were local street vendors selling their specialties, bellowing over their stands hoping to attract attention and share their gift to the rest of the world."}
{"text": "To his right were like minded shoppers, walking up and down the marketplace, inspecting the goods, wisely choosing what to spend their money on\u2014 as they did not have much to begin with."}
{"text": "\u201cWelcome to the city!\u201d Guizhong chirped, as she walked in front of Zhongli, with her back facing the front."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is where we\u2019ll be spending the rest of our day.\u201d\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that her walking backwards made him nervous."}
{"text": "\u201cDoes this city not have a name?\u201d Zhongli inquired, noting what Guizhong had called the city."}
{"text": "\u201cMmm, no,\u201d she started."}
{"text": "\u201cNot yet at least."}
{"text": "It seems the residents have yet to come up with one.\u201d \n\nBy now, she had resumed the normal way of walking, melting into her place besides Zhongli once again."}
{"text": "\u201cYou see, it has just been recently established.\u201d\n\nNot seeing the need to verbally respond, he nodded softly, signalling his understanding to Guizhong."}
{"text": "His passiveness,however, did not faze his female companion as she smirked at him, \u201cwho knows, maybe you can name it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI highly doubt the chances of that.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Zhongli\u2019s pessimism, she shrugged."}
{"text": "\u201cYou can never be too sure.\u201d\n\nJust as she had finished her sentence, a voice chimed in from the duo\u2019s left."}
{"text": "\u201cGuizhong!\u201d a booming voice beckoned."}
{"text": "\u201cJust how long has it been?\u201d \n\nBoth adeptis halted in their tracks, heads turning to their left to the source of the new voice."}
{"text": "The man who called for Guizhong seemed to be in his late 20s."}
{"text": "His hair was a light fluffy brown, bangs messy but the rest of its length was tied into a bun, the green ribbon flowing down behind him."}
{"text": "He wore a simple green colored garment, which further accentuated his fondness for the color."}
{"text": "Zhongli eyed Guizhong questioningly."}
{"text": "Guizhong, oblivious to Zhongli\u2019s silent inquiry, half-skipped her way to the stand and to the man awaiting her just on the other side of it."}
{"text": "\u201cAh!"}
{"text": "Guan Suo!\u201d Guizhong beamed at the man in question."}
{"text": "\u201cHas it been that long?"}
{"text": "I remember it only being a week or two.\u201d \n\nZhongli hesitantly followed Guizhong, halting in his tracks just beside her."}
{"text": "The stand was small in width, but long in length."}
{"text": "Zhongli noticed that it was home to many different types of pottery, its many many hues of colors, shapes, and sizes clashing with each other."}
{"text": "However, when all put together, the visual presentation was nonetheless stunning."}
{"text": "He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the stand alone attracted a good amount of curious onlookers."}
{"text": "It was the only color in the otherwise dull, wooden building behind the seller."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, it felt wayyy longer than that for me,\u201d Guan Suo responded, seemingly ecstatic at Guizhong\u2019s unexpected drop-by, completely ignoring Zhongli."}
{"text": "Ahem."}
{"text": "Both heads turned to Zhongli, the source of the sound."}
{"text": "Guizhong sent him a quick glare, seemingly upset at his rude way of interrupting her \u2018catching up\u2019 session."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is my good friend Zhongli,\u201d she nevertheless introduced him to the man over the stand."}
{"text": "\u201cZhongli, this is my other good friend, Guan Suo.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh!"}
{"text": "How nice to meet you!\u201d Guan Suo started, extending a hand towards Zhongli."}
{"text": "Zhongli stared at it until he felt a nudge at his side."}
{"text": "It was Guizhong ushering him to not leave the poor man hanging."}
{"text": "\u201cLikewise,\u201d he took it and gave Guan Suo a firm, solid shake, although begrudgingly."}
{"text": "To this, Guan Suo shrugged and continued his earlier conversation with Guizhong."}
{"text": "\u201cHow long will you be here for?"}
{"text": "Are you free later?"}
{"text": "We could grab something to eat and catch up.\u201d \n\nGuizhong looked at him apprehensively, \u201cAh, apologies Guan Suo."}
{"text": "I have something to attend to for the rest of the day today.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine too!\u201d he responded happily, although the disappointment was clear."}
{"text": "\u201cMaybe next time?\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, for sure!"}
{"text": "Just tell me when you\u2019re here and I\u2019ll close up shop early just for you m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\nZhongli noticed Guizhong\u2019s cheeks were now a slightly pinker shade than before."}
{"text": "Guizhong nodded happily at Guan Suo\u2019s suggestion."}
{"text": "Zhongli scoffed at the interaction."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you done now Guizhong?"}
{"text": "We must get going if you wish to finish the rest of your list.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at him, nodding in agreement."}
{"text": "\u201cAh you\u2019re right, we shall go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you next time Guan Suo,\u201d she waved at the man before turning to catch up to Zhongli who had already started the trek away."}
{"text": "\u201cLikewise,\u201d the man over the stand waved, as he looked at the two retreating backs."}
{"text": "~~~ \n\n\u201cZhongli wait up!\u201d Guizhong called as she struggled to catch up to him."}
{"text": "\u201cMust you be in such a hurry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am just attempting to finish your list in time,\u201d he responded, slowing down a bit for her."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, one item on my list was to introduce you to all my friends here,\u201d she said between breaths as she finally caught up to him."}
{"text": "Zhongli\u2019s eyes narrowed."}
{"text": "\u201cYou best think of a new one to replace that item or omit it altogether if that is the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm?"}
{"text": "How come?\u201d she looked up at him from her spot besides him as they continued to walk through the marketplace."}
{"text": "\u201cAlternatively, you can keep it and fail to convince me,\u201d he suggested."}
{"text": "\u201cSo far, your list is failing to do so.\u201d\n\nGuizhong sighed."}
{"text": "\u201cAlright."}
{"text": "I understand that you have trouble interacting with mere humans."}
{"text": "Thanks Grandpa, I\u2019ll keep that in mind."}
{"text": "\u201d\n\nZhongli ignored her."}
{"text": "\u201cAnyways, the location for one of my other items is just ahead of us!\u201d Guizhong pointed to a stand a few feet away from them."}
{"text": "\u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry cause it\u2019s time for lunch,\u201d grabbing Zhongli\u2019s arm, she dragged him to the place in question."}
{"text": "\u201cOur kind do not starve,\u201d Zhongli told her as he was being dragged after her."}
{"text": "\u201cWhatever, grandpa,\u201d she rolled her eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cAt least we\u2019re not impartial to taste.\u201d \n\n\u201cGuizhong!"}
{"text": "Pleasure seeing you here!\u201d a high, elated voice sounded from behind the stand."}
{"text": "The greeting belonged to a young female."}
{"text": "Under the sun, her hair shined a light brown, almost sandy."}
{"text": "Her light bangs, with two longer strands on either side of her face, framed her small face, giving her an even more youthful look."}
{"text": "The rest of her hair was held in a low braided bun, crowned with a green embroidered headpiece, with the rest of her attire being a light, almost pastel, blue."}
{"text": "\u201cBao!\u201d Guizhong chimed, lifting her right hand to wave at the girl behind the stand."}
{"text": "Her left hand pulled at Zhongli\u2019s sleeves, bringing him  closer to her, until they were only a few inches apart."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is Zhongli, a good friend of mine.\u201d\n\nBao directed her gaze to her friend\u2019s left and eyed the man in question up and down."}
{"text": "\u201cO-Oh my Guizhong,\u201d Bao\u2019s gaze stopped at the male adepti\u2019s face."}
{"text": "\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were friends with someone as attractive as him.\u201d\n\nGuizhong snorted at her friend\u2019s remark, knowing that adeptis can choose any form they wish to inhabit."}
{"text": "\u201cWell I had just met him,\u201d Guizhong shrugged."}
{"text": "\u201cAh!\u201d Bao\u2019s eyes widened as she remembered something."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Bao by the way."}
{"text": "Bao Sanniang.\u201d\n\nThe girl waved to Zhongli from behind the food stand."}
{"text": "\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d Zhongli responded, giving her a small smile, resulting in the female\u2019s now reddened cheeks."}
{"text": "\u201cS-So Guizhong, would you like the usual?\u201d deciding the man\u2019s attention was too much for her, Bao turned hers back to her friend."}
{"text": "\u201cYes please, but add just one more,\u201d Guizhong said, eyeing Zhongli."}
{"text": "\u201cGot it,\u201d Bao responded happily as she bent down to grab something from the stall\u2019s confines, starting Guizhong\u2019s orders."}
{"text": "\u201cSo,\u201d Guizhong turned to her partner for the day."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you have some mora prepared?\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Zhongli turned his attention down to her as the two waited for Bao in front of the stand."}
{"text": "\u201cMora.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cMora."}
{"text": "It\u2019s only the currency the whole of Teyvat uses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what it is,\u201d Zhongli deadpanned."}
{"text": "\u201cIt was named after me,\u201d he whispered the latter, rather aggressively."}
{"text": "Guizhong\u2019s eyes slightly widened at the newfound knowledge, lips parting to form a silent \u2018o\u2019 upon drawing the connection."}
{"text": "\u201cThen what on Teyvat are you asking for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any on me,\u201d he passively responded."}
{"text": "\u201cAh...,\u201d Guizhong was quick to catch on."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s still quite a shame,\u201d she giggled at the irony."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve never had the need for such trivial things,\u201d he said, indirectly hinting at the other part of Liyue, the one which mortals are not as familiar with."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Guizhong smiled at him, reaching inside her robe."}
{"text": "\u201cIt is my honor to pay for you.\u201d \n\nA few seconds later, she pulled out a pouch, lightly jiggling it in front of Zhongli, as if to silently show him its contents with the sound the bag made."}
{"text": "\u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not every day one can say they paid for the person mora was named after,\u201d she finished in a hushed whisper, making sure it was only heard between the both of them before giving him a quick wink."}
{"text": "To this, Zhongli could not help but chuckle, amused at Guizhong\u2019s way of thinking."}
{"text": "Unknowingly to her, his fondness for her was bigger than it was the day they first met."}
{"text": "~~~\n\n\u201cAnddd\u2026 done!\u201d Bao ringed in, appearing right behind the stand once again."}
{"text": "\u201cI really hope you two didn\u2019t wait long.\u201d\n\nGuizhong looked at her friend appreciatively."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t worry Bao, it wasn\u2019t that long a wait."}
{"text": "I should be the one apologizing for such a big order.\u201d \n\nBao smiled at Guizhong\u2019s concern."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve told you many many times before Guizhong!"}
{"text": "It\u2019s really alright, if anything I\u2019m glad I can help you in any way I can.\u201d\n\nSeemingly to ignore the chef\u2019s reassurance altogether, Guizhong flashed a sympathetic smile and paid for the food."}
{"text": "In exchange for the mora, Bao handed her a big basket and two skewers."}
{"text": "Zhongli motioned to help Guizhong with the basket, only to be shooed away by her hand smacking his."}
{"text": "He gave her a questioning look."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re only to hold this,\u201d she said as she handed him a skewer."}
{"text": "\u201cThey\u2019re chicken-mushroom skewers."}
{"text": "My favorite."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, but I should still help you with that basket,\u201d he reasoned as he took the single skewer from her extended hand."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I got it.\u201d she said as she tucked her mora pouch back into the pockets of her robes."}
{"text": "Guizhong then proceeded to take the other skewer from Bao."}
{"text": "She then worked to wrap her right hand securely over the basket, the right side of her body helping her to keep it safe from gravity\u2019s harm."}
{"text": "\u201cThanks again Bao,\u201d she turned to thank the bubbly girl once again before she would start her walk away."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome Guizhong!"}
{"text": "Make sure to come back soon, it\u2019ll be my treat next time!\u201d the chef smiled and waved at the pair separated from her by the stand."}
{"text": "\u201cYou too Zhongli, make sure to come again!\u201d she happily called to him."}
{"text": "Zhongli nodded in her direction, giving her his gentle smile, to which she blushed at once again."}
{"text": "~~~\n\nNow back on the main road, Zhongli and Guizhong joined the bustling crowd of people, melting in the midst of the laughter and chatter around them."}
{"text": "\u201cSo these are chicken-mushroom skewers?\u201d Zhongli asked as his hand motioned to bring the stick of delights up to his nose intending to smell the fragrance."}
{"text": "Guizhong looked up at him from his side and beamed at him."}
{"text": "\u201cYes!\u201d she responded giddily."}
{"text": "\u201cThey\u2019re really good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do smell quite nice,\u201d Zhongle mumbled in agreement."}
{"text": "\u201cThen?"}
{"text": "What are you waiting for?"}
{"text": "Hurry, try them!\u201d Guizhong half-shouted at him, eyes darting from him to the skewer in his hand, silently urging him to bring it to his mouth."}
{"text": "To her sudden demand, Zhongli lifted the skewer up to his chin and into his mouth, a motion Guizhong mirrored."}
{"text": "\u201cHaa."}
{"text": "Bao makes the best skewers in all of Liyue,\u201d Guizhong sighed delightedly, embellishing the warm first bite."}
{"text": "\u201cI can never get tired of them.\u201d\n\nAs Zhongli swallowed his first bite, a smile found its way to his face."}
{"text": "\u201cIt is quite\u2026,\u201d Zhongli started his statement, looking for the right word to finish it."}
{"text": "\u201cNice.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight?"}
{"text": "It\u2019s Bao\u2019s creation!\u201d Guizhong said as she motioned for another bite."}
{"text": "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, someday, it\u2019s famous around all of Liyue!\u201d \n\nMhm."}
{"text": "Zhongli hummed in agreement as he, too, enjoyed his second bite."}
{"text": "\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s in the basket?\u201d Zhongli asked as he continued to enjoy his skewer."}
{"text": "\u201cOh\u2014,\u201d Zhongli started but decided to swallow her food before continuing her sentence."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s more skewers.\u201d\n\nZhongli eyed her quizzically."}
{"text": "\u201cI doubt we are able to finish that, no matter how delicious it is.\u201d \n\n\u201cPfft,\u201d Guizhong tried to hold in a laugh."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not for us.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen who is it for?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the next group of people I intend to introduce you to.\u201d \n\nZhongli\u2019s gaze turned from a puzzled one to a curious one at her response."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he finally said as his mouth fought to resist a smile for the dozenth time that day."}
{"text": "\u201cLead the way.\u201d\n\n~~~\n\nAs they walked, the two adeptis eventually finished their skewers, held small talk as they walked, and attracted a lot of curious gazes."}
{"text": "But as often as they conversed, Zhongli never once asked Guizhong about their next location and its details."}
{"text": "He grew to wholeheartedly trust her and had faith in her as an adepti, and also as a friend."}
{"text": "Guizhong led the two of them to the very edge of the city."}
{"text": "As they strayed further from its heart, the bubbling laughter and chatter slowly dwindled out, the bustling crowd and busybodies were no more."}
{"text": "And at the very edge of the city, Zhongli saw a wooden house, fairly isolated from the rest of its counterparts that made the city what it was."}
{"text": "A worn down wooden fence bordered the house\u2019s circumference, giving it a fairly large amount of space to claim as its down."}
{"text": "Zhongli\u2019s growing suspicion of their next hotspot for the day was confirmed as Guizhong continued her trek towards the house."}
{"text": "\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d she beamed as they were a few feet away from the gate\u2019s entrance."}
{"text": "\u201cThe orphanage!\u201d\n\nAs if on cue with Guizhong\u2019s introduction of the place, children ran out of the house\u2019s doors and towards the female adepti."}
{"text": "\u201cSister Guizhong!\u201d \n\n\u201cLady Guizhong!\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Guizhong!\u201d\n\nAlthough Zhongli only heard a few of the many titles the children referred Guizhong as, he picked up nothing but excitement, happiness, and respect from their tone."}
{"text": "\u201cGuizhong!\u201d A gentle voice sounded from the back of the excited group."}
{"text": "It belonged to an older woman."}
{"text": "Age and experience planted itself into her face, in all the wrinkles, scars, and tears."}
{"text": "Her hair, more or less gray, was wrapped in a tight, neat bun at the back of her head giving her a regal, tidy look."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d the lady, now at the front of the pack, greeted fondly."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat an unexpected surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Guizhong answered, matching the lady\u2019s fondness."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m here to pass these to the kid.\u201d \n\nSimultaneously, Guizhong lifted the basket of chicken-mushroom skewer delights up, proudly showing off to the group surrounding her."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m also here as I have someone to introduce to you all!\u201d she added happily, ushering Zhongli to walk up from his timid place behind her."}
{"text": "To her statement, all eyes turned to the nervous adepti."}
{"text": "The staring eyes made him uncomfortable as he stepped up and found his place besides Guizhong."}
{"text": "\u201cEveryone, this is my new good friend, Zhongli!\u201d \n\nOut of habit from god knows where, Zhongli timidly dipped his head, awkwardly bowing as the group continued to stare at him."}
{"text": "\u201cNice to meet you Mr. Zhongli,\u201d a shy voice from below peeped up."}
{"text": "Zhongli resumed his standing position, gaze turned towards the source of the voice."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Remi,\u201d a girl, around the young age of 7, smiled at Zhongli, flashing him her toothless grin."}
{"text": "To her awkward introduction, the other kids rushed to do the same, surrounding themselves around the tall, unexpecting man."}
{"text": "While the children\u2019s attention was focused on Zhongli, Guizhong walked up to the older lady, their sole caretaker."}
{"text": "\u201cMadame Peng, I\u2019m sorry for coming unannounced,\u201d she apologized as she went to place the basket on the table not far from them."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t be, child."}
{"text": "The children are always excited to have you here,\u201d the older lady responded to her."}
{"text": "\u201cAs am I.\u201d\n\nGuizhong smiled at the lady."}
{"text": "\u201cHe\u2019s a good person,\u201d Madame Peng continued as she eyed Zhongli, who was trying his best to interact with the plethora of kids surrounding him."}
{"text": "Guizhong nodded and smiled as her gaze fell on the scene before the two."}
{"text": "\u201cHe really is.\u201d\n\nMadame Peng shifted her attention to the female adepti."}
{"text": "\u201cYou two make a good pair.\u201d \n\n\u201cH-He\u2019s just a friend,\u201d Guizhong flailed her hands as she tried to deny the older woman\u2019s smug remark."}
{"text": "Not finding the need to say anything to further provoke the poor girl, Madame Peng smiled satisfactorily at Guizhong\u2019s denial, not missing the bright pink her cheeks were flushed with."}
{"text": "~~~\n\nThe sky was now basked in a strong tinge of warm colors, from orange, to pink, to yellow, and even purple if one squints hard enough at the horizon."}
{"text": "As in response to the sky\u2019s change, the clouds followed suit, tinging itself with lighter shades of purple, yellow, and pink."}
{"text": "As the sun prepared itself for slumber, two figures were sitting at the front porch of a wooden house, basking in the sun\u2019s last rays before night befell all of Teyvat."}
{"text": "\u201cSo Morax,\u201d Guizhong turned to her partner in crime for the day."}
{"text": "\u201cHow did you like today?\u201d\n\nTo her inquiry, the man in question further relaxed his shoulders, his arms resting behind him, serving as a stand as the rest of his tall body leaned back."}
{"text": "\u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d he responded as he looked to the horizon."}
{"text": "Guizhong smiled at him, before joining him in looking to the horizon as well."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she sighed blissfully as she closed her eyes, letting the celestial body\u2019s rays warm her face."}
{"text": "As Zhongli\u2019s gaze came back to her, he was taken aback by how peaceful his counterpart looked at the hands of golden hour."}
{"text": "Although gods like themselves could take on any form they wished, he couldn\u2019t help but think how well the God of Dust\u2019s chosen form fitted her."}
{"text": "Her long, silky hair was sprawled behind her back."}
{"text": "Under the sun\u2019s rays, it looked golden, bordering a light hue of orange."}
{"text": "Her face had a hint of serenity to it as she basked under the sun, brown eyes lidded with delicate lashes crowning its edges."}
{"text": "Morax had probably been staring for too long as Guizhong had come to sense his gaze on her."}
{"text": "She turned to him, head tilting forwards in puzzlement, silently asking him, \u2018what is it.\u2019\n\nHe shook his head, \u2018nothing\u2019."}
{"text": "At his verbal-less response, she raised her eyebrow, seemingly continuing their silent conversation."}
{"text": "\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019\n\nMorax ignored her facial expression."}
{"text": "Guizhong broke their silent conversation and asked aloud, \u201cSo are you at least more fond of \u2018weak\u2019 humans now?\u201d\n\nHe smiled at her and lightly nodded, \u201cIt seems my expectations for them were lower than should be.\u201d \n\nGuizhong\u2019s eyes widened, an elated smile quickly crept its way to her cheeks, proud of her accomplishment."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d the male started."}
{"text": "\u201cIf you are still willing, I\u2019ll be the brawn to your brains.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nI wonder, do the people of Liyue still remember you?"}
{"text": "Are they grateful that an adepti as intelligent, elegant, and kind as you had poured in so much to help their pitiful species?"}
{"text": "Do they remember the you who was friendly and welcoming to them, the you who had befriended them, the you who was as affectionate as you were to them?"}
{"text": "Or perhaps they have all forgotten."}
{"text": "Am I the only one that recalls your existence?"}
{"text": "Does the memory of you haunt their subconscious as much as you do mine?"}
{"text": "Do they miss you as much as I do?"}
{"text": "\ud83c\udf3c 3."}
{"text": "Until We Meet Again\n\n\"Fortify the bones, that movement be supple when the time comes.\""}
{"text": "\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nIn the the eerily, yet comfy, walls of Liyue\u2019s Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the scritching and scratching of a running quill can faintly be\u2014\n\u201cMr."}
{"text": "Zhongli!\u201d a loud, high-pitched voice rang through the thin walls, permeating every hidden nook and crevice in the humble parlor."}
{"text": "It was almost a yell, just not quite there yet."}
{"text": "The named person lightly groaned at the sudden call, annoyed at its unexpectedness, and frustrated at the new mark on his parchment paper."}
{"text": "A quick glance and one could tell it was there, that it wasn\u2019t meant to be there, but there it was\u2014 intrusive and permanent."}
{"text": "Deciding there was nothing he could do, Zhongli set the quill down on a cloth beside the parchment, already spread open, waiting for the quill."}
{"text": "As if on cue, a head popped out from behind the wall (but really, it was a folding screen, pretending to be a wall\u2014 but hey\u2014 it does its job quite well so who was he to complain?)."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that too loud?\u201d Hu Tao, manager of the funeral parlor, inquired."}
{"text": "\u201cQuite so,\u201d Zhongli looked up at her."}
{"text": "\u201cA\u2026 less subtle warning would have been welcomed.\u201d\nHu Tao sheepishly smiled at his hint but disregarded it altogether in the seconds that followed."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, the traveller, Paimon, and Mr. Childe are waiting for you outside.\u201d\n\u201cTell them I\u2019ll be a little later.\u201d\nHu Tao blinked at him."}
{"text": "\u201cThey\u2019re literally already here."}
{"text": "Outside."}
{"text": "Waiting for you,\u201d with her arms now folded, she continued."}
{"text": "\u201cShould I at least invite them in?"}
{"text": "For some tea?\u201d\n\u201cHow will I know you won\u2019t poison them for more corpses?\u201d\nHu Tao\u2019s eyes widened, subtly pouting at what her underling had just said about her."}
{"text": "\u201cSince when did you have a sense of humor?"}
{"text": "I must\u2019ve at least missed a few chapters\u2014 books even.\u201d\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s necessary to have them,\u201d he responded, eyes scanning the piece of paper beneath him up and down."}
{"text": "\u201cFound for effect and necessity.\u201d\n \u201cThat made no sense.\u201d\nWith eyes still on the paper, the (ex(?))"}
{"text": "Adepti shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, leaving Hu Tao\u2019s comment up for interpretation."}
{"text": "\u201cSo how long are you gonna take?\u201d Hu Tao started up again."}
{"text": "\u201cShould I just invite them in for tea?\u201d\nTo her repeated inquisition, Zhongli stood up from his chair."}
{"text": "After seemingly contemplating the decision, he took the parchment in his hands and crumbled it in his right fist."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll be out now.\u201d\nThe crumbled parchment was abandoned on the side of his desk, its content meant to be never revisited again."}
{"text": "He\u2019ll properly dispose of it later, when an out of place traveller, their even more out of place travelling companion, and an annoying Fatui harbinger weren\u2019t just outside the doorsteps of his workplace."}
{"text": "\u201cPff, took you long enough, Grandpa.\u201d\nMaybe Hu Tao wasn\u2019t an observant person, maybe she was too annoyed by the tall man\u2014 or maybe it was a little bit of both\u2014 but the subtle tense in Zhongli\u2019s shoulders went unnoticed by the only other person in the room; the one who had called him an almost-too familiar noun."}
{"text": "\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nGuizhong,\nPresent day Liyue is so very different from the Liyue we\u2019ve come to know then."}
{"text": "A lot has changed, some inevitably, some not quite so."}
{"text": "This is the first time I\u2019m formally addressing you, by name, in my letters\u2014 well\u2014 to you."}
{"text": "To be more concise, this time will be the first, only, and last time I\u2019ll ever do so."}
{"text": "On a related note, this letter will also be the only one I will properly end, by which I mean, I will sign it."}
{"text": "These past two weeks have been\u2026 different."}
{"text": "I dare compare it to \u2018when you entered my life\u2019 type of different."}
{"text": "In such a short amount of time, I had come to meet several\u2026 rather peculiar, persons."}
{"text": "And the thing is, they all remind me of you."}
{"text": "I am not quite sure if this is Teyvat\u2019s way of toying with me, especially after all these years, but as inconvenient and unexpected as it was, I don\u2019t think I mind it."}
{"text": "However, a small part of me doubt all this being Teyvat\u2019s doing."}
{"text": "You see, when they came to Liyue, it felt as if my consistent life was tipped, ever so slightly, from its equilibrium."}
{"text": "And as subtle as that tilt was, it\u2019s hard."}
{"text": "Hard to not notice it\u2014 especially because if you\u2019ve been working for centuries to get used to that\u2026 balance."}
{"text": "And to have it all rerouted by the addition of a single person; I can\u2019t help but think it a bit cruel."}
{"text": "The traveller\u2014 the one responsible for this all\u2014 isn\u2019t from this world."}
{"text": "If my memory serves me correctly, they have come to look for their lost sibling."}
{"text": "A tragic tale, really."}
{"text": "But it isn\u2019t their sob story that attracted me to them, it was their will, their strength, their determination, and their love for their sibling."}
{"text": "You can tell how strong of a familial bond they have."}
{"text": "It\u2019s something I quite envy, actually\u2026 but that\u2019s between you and me."}
{"text": "The traveller\u2019s companion, Paimon (I think), isn\u2019t so much different."}
{"text": "I don\u2019t think she belongs to this world either."}
{"text": "But how beautiful is that?"}
{"text": "Two foreign entities, seeking solace and companionship in the other."}
{"text": "They are both quite far from home, but it seems to me that they have home in each other."}
{"text": "I wish I had someone as close to me as Paimon is to the traveller\u2026 How funny that\u2026 a part of me thinks it could\u2019ve been you and me."}
{"text": "As alien as both the traveller and Paimon are, it was a bit surprising to see that I am not their only acquaintance in this world."}
{"text": "They must be really social\u2014 like you."}
{"text": "Childe also tags along with them, following them around just like a dog would its owner."}
{"text": "It humors me, honestly."}
{"text": "I can\u2019t help but notice something a bit off about him though."}
{"text": "He works for Signora, someone I\u2019ve been in recent contact with."}
{"text": "And Signora works for The Tsaritsa, who just so happen to be collecting every other archon\u2019s gnosis."}
{"text": "And I\u2019m looking to give mine up."}
{"text": "La Signora and I have an ongoing contract\u2026 Regarding what, I cannot say."}
{"text": "But if I know her well enough, she will keep her end of it for sure."}
{"text": "And I will have to mine."}
{"text": "Anyways, besides being a Fatui Harbinger, something seems a bit off about him."}
{"text": "Even after all these years, I still have trouble putting my thoughts into words but it seems like\u2026 He laughs, quite a lot."}
{"text": "Only to keep from crying."}
{"text": "But who am I to assume?"}

{"text": "Some things are to be kept between you and me."}
{"text": "Lastly, but surely not least, there\u2019s Hu Tao, my manager."}
{"text": "She\u2019s only recently been my manager though, maybe about two weeks or so-ish."}
{"text": "Remember our mora conversation and that one time you took honor in paying for me?"}
{"text": "Well, it seems like that thought wasn\u2019t universal."}
{"text": "It wasn\u2019t like that at first though\u2026 but alas, as time passed, so did the traveller and Childe\u2019s willingness to pay for me."}
{"text": "(If you were to read this, you would be holding in your laughter right now."}
{"text": "I know so."}
{"text": "You do not have permission to laugh, by the way, so kindly keep holding onto it.)"}
{"text": "Out of everyone, I think Hu Tao\u2026 tops the category for being unusual."}
{"text": "But she pays for me, which is why I can tolerate her and enjoy going out with her more often than the rest\u2014 I\u2019ve only ever been really expressing the former."}
{"text": "Now that I think about it, this \u2018relationship\u2019 reminds me of you and me."}
{"text": "I highly doubt I\u2019m kidding anyone, everyone reminds me of you."}
{"text": "Perhaps it was their personalities that reminded me of yours, and ultimately you."}
{"text": "Or perhaps I was so used to your qualities that I can\u2019t help but relate them to you."}
{"text": "But perhaps they were just a few of many qualities that attracted me all the more to you; and even after all these hundreds of years, those qualities that I found in you had attracted me to them."}
{"text": "Maybe humans aren\u2019t so bad."}
{"text": "And maybe their feelings aren\u2019t so bad either."}
{"text": "I think I understand them a bit more now\u2014 human feelings."}
{"text": "However, I\u2019m far from being as adept at them as you are\u2026\n\nEven then, I think I went ahead and loved you anyway."}
{"text": "I still have a lot more time to figure this all out\u2014 feelings, I mean\u2014 even though it may be out of my right to do so\u2026 who ever knows for sure?"}
{"text": "I\u2019m unsure when I\u2019ll see you again."}
{"text": "So I\u2019m unsure when these letters will find their way to you."}
{"text": "But let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re more for me than for you."}
{"text": "When the time comes, I doubt I\u2019ll even share these with you\u2026 for reasons I will not disclose."}
{"text": "But if I recall, our contract still stands, so I\u2019ll have plenty more opportunity to find you when the time comes for me."}
{"text": "I haven\u2019t unlocked your puzzle\u2026 Even after all these years I still am unable to unlock the puzzle you have entrusted me with."}
{"text": "I don\u2019t think I ever will to be honest."}
{"text": "Where did all my confidence go, I wonder."}
{"text": "Please don\u2019t answer that, it was a rhetorical question."}
{"text": "You and I both know the answer to it: they left about the same time you did."}
{"text": "Until then, please wait for me where the glaze lilies bloom."}
{"text": "No matter how long that may be."}
{"text": "With love,\nZhongli (Morax) \u2014 God of Contracts, Former (...Maybe?"}

{"text": "What on Teyvat kept you so long?\u201d\nJust as Hu Tao and Zhongli opened the door to the Funeral Parlor, a small, flying creature, greeted them."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry about that guys, Zhongli had something to attend to,\u201d Hu Tao smiled at the awaiting trio, half apologizing for her employee and half blaming him."}
{"text": "\u201cFor making me wait out here in this weather, you owe me something delicious for dinner,\u201d Paimon said, squeaky voice laced with impatience."}
{"text": "\u201cPaimon, we haven\u2019t even had lunch yet,\u201d a blonde person spoke up, almost scolding her."}
{"text": "\u201cMy apologies, how about we go find somewhere for lunch?\u201d Zhongli suggested."}
{"text": "\u201cOh?"}
{"text": "And you will be paying for us, right?\u201d a tall figure spoke up from the back."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s right!"}
{"text": "Zhongli has to pay for whatever we\u2019re going to eat!"}
{"text": "He owes it to us!\u201d Paimon spoke up, nodding furiously to agree with Childe."}
{"text": "\u201cOh?"}
{"text": "If Zhongli is paying, can I tag along?\u201d Hu Tao asked."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s almost time to close up for lunch break anyways."}
{"text": "And Zhongli paying is something I wouldn\u2019t want to miss for the world.\u201d\nA series of chuckles and giggles erupted from everyone but the man of the hour himself."}
{"text": "\u201cIf I must,\u201d Zhongli started, visibly annoyed."}
{"text": "\u201cCan we consider chicken mushroom skewers?\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Hu Tao brought her index finger up to her chin, in a contemplating manner."}
{"text": "\u201cThey\u2019re quite\u2026 cheap."}
{"text": "As this is your first time paying, can\u2019t you be a bit more generous?\u201d\nThe other three nodded vigorously, agreeing with Hu Tao, internally grateful for her outright manner as she asked the question they all had wanted to ask."}
{"text": "\u201cNegative.\u201d Zhongli\u2019s eyes narrowed down on them."}
{"text": "\u201cMy net worth isn\u2019t high.\u201d\nHu Tao giggled at the response she was given."}
{"text": "\u201cFair, I doubt you can even live a comfortable life with your pay.\u201d\n\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d\n\u201cSo chicken skewers it is?\u201d Childe perked up."}
{"text": "\u201cI don\u2019t know about you rest, but I\u2019m getting really impatient.\u201d\n\u201cIs it the heat or hunger?\u201d Paimon questioned, pointing to his stomach."}
{"text": "The traveller laughed, \u201cIt might be a combined effort of both, Paimon.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know me so well,\u201d Childe flashed a grin at the traveller."}
{"text": "\u201cShall we go then?\u201d Zhongli asked."}
{"text": "\u201cMy offer only stands for so long.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s!\u201d Hu Tao said, pointing to the direction of the Liyue Harbor market."}
{"text": "The group of four\u2014 5 if Paimon counts\u2014 made their way to the marketplace, basking in not only the sun overhead, but in each other\u2019s laughter and excited chatter."}
{"text": "Ding!"}
{"text": "Chongyun preemptively looks up from his phone, away from the source of the sound."}
{"text": "He surveys his surroundings, making eye contact with everyone who had turned to the chime of his mobile device\u2014 no doubt judging him."}
{"text": "Every pair of eyes he made contact with, he would flash them a sorry smile, polite (and fake) to the point of painful."}
{"text": "Not counting the curious onlookers blocked from his peripheral by the many many bookshelves lining the library walls, he was sure he had silently apologized to everyone; but it wasn\u2019t like he was keeping score."}
{"text": "Oops, sorry about that."}
{"text": "My bad!"}
{"text": "To everyone but the person across the table from him."}
{"text": "\u201cSeriously?"}
{"text": "!\u201d Xingqiu hushes from behind his book, raised criminally high to shield him from the embarrassment that was his college roommate and longtime best friend."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Chongyun whispers back, now leaning over the table, shortening the distance between them."}
{"text": "\u201cText from Xiangling,\u201d he finishes his apology all the while shoving the blame to a certain short-haired girl."}
{"text": "Whether his remark was intended as that or not is up in the air for Xingqiu\u2019s internal debate."}
{"text": "Xingqiu rolls his eyes as a silent response, returning back to his waiting book."}
{"text": "After he was sure that Xingqiu had forgiven him, Chongyun motions to his phone and switches the sidebar, silencing his phone for the rest of forever\u2014 or until he feels like switching it again."}
{"text": "He swipes to unlock it and checks for Xiangling\u2019s unopened message."}
{"text": "Messages."}
{"text": "[Ramsay\nToday at 9:05 AM\nHey are you and Xingqiu free later today?"}
{"text": "Today at 3:32 PM\nOkay it\u2019s \u2018later today\u2019 right now."}

{"text": "At his best friend\u2019s request, Xingqiu looks up from his book and raises his left eyebrow."}
{"text": "What?"}
{"text": "\u201cXiangling wants to meet with us at that one cafe today.\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cAt\u2026\u201d Chongyun lets his words trail as he looks down at Xiangling\u2019s messages for the second time that day."}
{"text": "\u201cIn, like, 5 minutes.\u201d\nAt Chongyun\u2019s response, Xingqiu shuts his book quite forcibly\u2014 something Chongyun flinched at."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me this sooner because?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see her message until just now.\u201d\n\u201cRight."}
{"text": "You mean when you interrupted no one but every single breathing person in this room?\u201d\nUnable to find the right words to respond to his friend\u2019s remark, Chongyun flashes a light smile and lightly shrugs his shoulders."}
{"text": "Sorry."}
{"text": "\u201cWhatever, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Xingqiu starts as he gets up from his chair, pushes it under the desk, and throws his backpack over his shoulders, book tucked in his hands."}
{"text": "\u201cWe should get going if we hope to make it.\u201d\n\u201cYessir.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChime."}
{"text": "The door to the campus caf\u00e9 chimes, announcing the arrival of the pair as they step over the threshold."}
{"text": "\u201cAh, there you guys are!\u201d Xiangling cheers as she gets up from her chair to make room for the addition of two new guests at their small table."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, you two are late,\u201d Kazuha says as he lifts his half-empty drink, meeting the straw halfway."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Hu Tao interrupts."}
{"text": "\u201cBetter later than never.\u201d\n\u201cYup, now we can finally start our very important discussion!\u201d Xinyan declares, preventing the group from straying too far from their intended reason for meeting in the first place."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, what did you guys want to talk to us about?\u201d Chongyun asks, now seated between Xinyan and Xingqiu."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s so important that it got me in trouble with Xingqiu and more or less embarrassed the living shit out of me in front of everyone else?\u201d\nAt Chongyun\u2019s rhetorical question, Hu Tao raises her eyebrows in a half-amusing and half-tell-me-what-happened-later manner."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic Chongyun,\u201d Xingqiu scolds him."}
{"text": "\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nXiangling stops, gears turning in her head as she thinks of how she can execute her idea to her awaiting friends."}
{"text": "\u201cSince it\u2019s near Thanksgiving time, I was wondering if you guys are down to hold a\u2026\u201d she stops, looking for the right word."}
{"text": "\u201cDinner\u2026 party.\u201d\n\u201cDinner party?\u201d Xinyan asks from her spot questioningly."}
{"text": "\u201cLike one of those formal ones?\u201d\nXiangling shakes her head."}
{"text": "\u201cNo, an informal, friends-only type beat of dinner party.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m in,\u201d Kazuha says as he takes another sip of his drink."}
{"text": "\u201cWho\u2019s hosting it though?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here to decide,\u201d Xiangling replies almost smugly as she reaches into her tote bag, fumbling around for something."}
{"text": "It was almost as if she knew what her friends\u2019 answer would be, even before verbally confirming it; almost."}
{"text": "\u201cHere!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Hu Tao asks, looking from Xiangling to the sticks in the girl\u2019s hands."}
{"text": "\u201cWe\u2019ll gamble on it."}
{"text": "The person who pulls the shortest stick is responsible for hosting it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what if that unfortunate soul just so happens to be a roommate with someone else here?\u201d Xingqiu hesitantly asks."}
{"text": "Though he knew the answer, he felt the question should be asked regardless\u2014 in case he was wrong, which he usually isn\u2019t, but just in case."}
{"text": "Xiangling smiles pitifully at him as she knew where he was going with his inquiry."}
{"text": "\u201cThen you should  help them prepare for the best dinner party ever.\u201d\nTo her response, Xingqiu slumps further into his chair, hoping and wishing that neither he nor Chongyun draws the shortest stick."}
{"text": "Unfortunately for him, with the two of them combined, the chances of doing so just so happen to be slightly higher than the rest."}
{"text": "\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Xiangling asks as she prepares for the fateful draw and spreads out the sticks so her friends can easily pull from."}
{"text": "\u201cOn the count of 3, everyone grab one.\u201d\n\u201c1\u2026\u201d\n\u201c2\u2026\u201d\n3!\u201d\nThe sticks in Xianglang\u2019s hands began to disperse one after another."}
{"text": "\u201cSo who\u2019s got it?\u201d Hu Tao asks, looking at hers, then to the rest of her friends."}
{"text": "\u201cI think\u2026 I did\u2026\u201d Chongyun mutters, squinting his eyes down at his as if trying to find the rest of its length\u2014 something he failed to do."}
{"text": "\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Kazuha starts."}
{"text": "\u201cHere, compare it to the rest of ours.\u201d\nSix sticks were put close to each other towards the center of the table."}
{"text": "\u201cDamn."}
{"text": "Looks like it really is me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Xiangling reassures as she reaches to pat Chongyun\u2019s sullen back from where she sat."}
{"text": "\u201cYou have Xingqiu, you two will be fine.\u201d\n\u201cI digress,\u201d Xingqiu mutters, glaring at Chongyun\u2019s shamefully short stick, his monologue cursing at the ill-fated thing."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the bestest informal dinner party!\u201d Xiangling muses, choosing to ignore Xingqiu\u2019s comment altogether."}
{"text": "The rest of the friend group nod in agreement, excited about the idea of dinner together and even more excited that it won\u2019t be hosted at their respective abodes."}
{"text": "\u201cHow about meeting at their place at 7:00 pm sharp on Thanksgiving day?\u201d Xiangling suggests as she stands up, hinting at her departure."}
{"text": "\u201cEveryone\u2019s free at that time, right?\u201d\nXinyan, Hu Tao, and Kazuha nodded."}
{"text": "\u201cSeven is too late, how are we gonna do all the things we want to without pulling an all-nighter?\u201d Chongyun questions."}
{"text": "\u201cHow about you guys come at 6:00 instead?\u201d\nXingqiu sent Chongyun a silent side-glare but it seems he was a moment behind."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m fine with that time,\u201d Kazuha says\u2014 rather almost quickly."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat about the rest of you?\u201d\nThis time, it was Hu Tao, Xinyan, and  Xiangling who nodded."}
{"text": "\u201cCool!"}
{"text": "That\u2019s that then,\u201d Xinyan says happily."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve got to go to my band now, see ya guys later!\u201d\nWith that, Xinyan steps out the door, guitar strapped behind her back, patiently waiting to be strummed."}
{"text": "\u201cKazuha and I have to go to the poetry club too,\u201d Hu Tao adds."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you coming with, Xingqiu?\u201d\nXingqiu nods his head."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll be there shortly."}
{"text": "You guys can go ahead.\u201d\nHu Tao shrugs as she and Kazuha head to the door and out into the world of college club life."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m not as busy as the rest of them but I do have this new recipe I\u2019ve been dying to try out,\u201d Xiangling says as she takes a few steps away from their table, gesturing to the door."}
{"text": "\u201cGood luck guys!\u201d \nAnd with that, the one responsible for the Thanksgiving dinner was out the door, shoulders free of any more responsibility for the occasion, as if she was only meant to suggest it."}
{"text": "At their friends\u2019 departure, Chongyun hesitantly shuffles between the now empty seats."}
{"text": "He\u2019s\u2014 once again\u2014 across from Xingqiu."}
{"text": "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAchoo!"}
{"text": "\u201cBless you,\u201d Xingqiu calmly says, keeping his eyes on the road as he reverses from the local market\u2019s (rather small) parking lot."}
{"text": "Chongyun mutters a sorry thank you as he reaches for his seatbelt in the passenger seat."}
{"text": "\u201cSo what\u2019s next on our list?\u201d Xingqiu questions."}
{"text": "\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Chongyun starts as he unlocked his phone and opens the Notes app."}
{"text": "\u201cWe put\u2014 and I quote word for word\u2014 chicken or turkey.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Xingqiu grimaces."}
{"text": "\u201cWere the past us really that indecisive?\u201d\n\u201cGuess so."}
{"text": "But it\u2019s really only just the us from 2 nights ago.\u201d\n\u201cSo which one are we getting?"}
{"text": "So I know where to drive.\u201d\n\u201cSince it\u2019s Thanksgiving, shouldn\u2019t we go for turkey?\u201d Chongyun suggests the obvious answer."}
{"text": "Xingqiu nods subtly, eyes still on the road ahead."}
{"text": "\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\n~~~\n\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019re here,\u201d Xingqiu states rather adamantly as he puts his car in park."}
{"text": "\u201cYou can go in and buy it.\u201d\n\u201cAlrighty,\u201d Chongyun says as he reaches for the door and opens it."}
{"text": "\u201cBe back in a bit.\u201d\n\u201cMake sure you close the door on your way out,\u201d  Xingqiu lightly says as he reaches for his book tucked under the armrest."}
{"text": "He barely turns the page before\u2014\n\n\u201cHey so uh\u2026\u201d Chongyun says, opening the door, rather hurriedly."}
{"text": "\u201cHm?\u201d Xingqiu looks up from his book."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s like,\u201d Chongyun hesitates before continuing."}
{"text": "\u201cA protest against the turkey-selling place.\u201d\nWith the passenger side door fully opened, Xingqiu can hear what Chongyun was alluding to."}
{"text": "He turns over his shoulder, looking for the sound."}
{"text": "Lo and behold, there the group was."}
{"text": "Sign-raising, yelling(?"}
{"text": "), and protesting."}
{"text": "\u201cQuite admirable,\u201d Xingqiu thinks his thoughts aloud."}
{"text": "\u201cRight,\u201d Chongyun agrees hesitantly as he leans into the car, right hand over the hood (which Xingqiu totally finds attractive but that\u2019s to be kept to himself till death renders it unshareable to the rest of the unknowing world)."}
{"text": "\u201cAre we still up for turkey?\u201d the sky blue-haired boy asks, unwilling to get back in his seat."}
{"text": "He contemplates for a second."}
{"text": "\u201cY\u2019know what, never mind,\u201d he corrects himself and steps into the car, strapping in his seatbelt once again."}
{"text": "\u201cWe should reconsider.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Xingqiu looks at him questioningly."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re not getting the turkey?"}
{"text": "No one in the group is vegetarian ya know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah but\u2026 it would be weird.\u201d \n\u201cHow so?\u201d Xingqiu perks his head to the side, failing to catch on."}
{"text": "\u201cBecause they\u2019re literally right at the entrance."}
{"text": "If I  were to go inside and come back out with fresh turkey then that would just be awkward.\u201d\nXingqiu takes a moment to respond, no doubt considering what his best friend had said."}
{"text": "\u201cI guess so, but why does it even matter?"}
{"text": "Yes, they\u2019re commendable for protesting but we still need our fresh turkey."}
{"text": "And they\u2019re not stopping us from getting it."}
{"text": "Not to mention it\u2019s Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\u201cBut can\u2019t we get it somewhere else?"}
{"text": "I\u2019m not going in there."}
{"text": "You can go.\u201d\nXingqiu deadpans at Chongyun\u2019s response, the familiar feeling of pettiness surging back into him."}
{"text": "\u201cFine."}
{"text": "I\u2019ll drive us back to the market."}
{"text": "You\u2019re going in."}
{"text": "It was you that got us in this mess in the first place.\u201d \nChongyun rolls his eyes at the proposed ultimatum."}
{"text": "\u201cFine\u2014 but just so you know, we already lost the draw when we became roommates."}
{"text": "The odds were against us.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, I just hope the market turkey is as good as the one here,\u201d Xingqiu mutters as he hesitantly turns on the left signal and puts his car in drive."}
{"text": "\u201cElse we won\u2019t hear the end of it from our resident chef.\u201d \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHuff."}
{"text": "\u201cCan you sigh any louder?\u201d Xingqiu berates his roommate as he places his grocery bag next to Chongyun\u2019s on the small counter of their apartment."}
{"text": "\u201cApologies kind sir,\u201d Chongyun sarcastically replies."}
{"text": "\u201cI will keep my fatigue-ness in check the next time I\u2019m around your divine presence.\u201d \nXingqiu rolls his eyes as he works to clear the paper bag of its contents."}
{"text": "It was just another day living with the sky-blue-haired boy."}
{"text": "Chongyun works to do the same."}
{"text": "\u201cAlright,\u201d Xingqiu starts as he opens a cookbook he had found on one of the cabinets of their kitchen, flipping through the pages."}
{"text": "\u201cShould we start with setting up the plates?"}
{"text": "Since it\u2019s simple to do so?\u201d\n\u201cPaper plates, right?\u201d Chongyun verbally confirms as he unwraps the paper plates and plastic utensils from their respective packages."}
{"text": "Xingqiu nods as he continues to flip through the pages, looking for their desired dishes: roast turkey, mash potatoes and gravy, egg rolls, crystal shrimp, golden shrimp balls, and ice cream for dessert."}

{"text": "\u201cXingqiu.\u201d\nThe named man looks up from the open book."}
{"text": "\u201cHow many sets do we need?"}
{"text": "6 right?"}
{"text": "Kazuha, Xinyan, you, me, Xiangling\u2026\u201d Chongyun trails off, counting the names of guests on his fingers."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd Hu Tao, so yeah, the 6 of us,\u201d Xingqiu responds."}
{"text": "\u201cBut can you add one more?"}
{"text": "I invited Albedo as thanks for helping draw the cover of my last novel.\u201d\n\u201cYou and your book nerds, got it\u201d Chongyun verifies as he takes out another set for the seventh person."}
{"text": "Xingqiu shrugs nonchalantly as he works to flip through the rest of the cookbook, marking every recipe with a post-it note."}
{"text": "The clock strikes 1:00 pm."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m done setting up the plates, are we ready to get the show on the road?\u201d Chongyun steps back into their small kitchen."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah."}
{"text": "For the most part, we are,\u201d Xingqiu looks up from the book."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll split up the courses and assign us to one of each so we can finish faster,\u201d he proposes."}
{"text": "\u201cTake out your phone and take a picture of the ice cream, egg rolls, and crystal shrimp recipe.\u201d \nOn Xingqiu\u2019s command, Chongyun leans in to take a picture of all the recipes verbally listed."}
{"text": "Away from Xingqiu\u2019s knowledge (until he decides to open Discord and check for himself), Chongyun snuck a text to the group."}
{"text": "[monky shrine - 6 Members\n\npopsicle boyo Today at 1:01 pm\nYou guys are def not rdy for tonight kaka :blushes:\n\nWalnut is typing\u2026 \n]\n\n2:03 pm."}
{"text": "As the two cooks, the childhood friends found a steady rhythm to work with\u2014 in the small kitchen that would\u2019ve made it harder if they were anything otherwise."}
{"text": "The speakers are turned on to max volume, blasting Chongyun\u2019s Spotify playlist: fever dream."}
{"text": "(The fact that Chongyun used his phone for only music in the kitchen irritated Xingqiu."}
{"text": "It means that he isn\u2019t following the recipe; that he wasn\u2019t following the book and its step-by-step instructions.)"}
{"text": "\u201cWe should turn it down before we get another noise complaint.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s Thanksgiving, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll spare us a night.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly because of Thanksgiving that we should spare them a night,\u201d Xingqiu corrects and smacks his partner-in-crime\u2019s shoulder with the unused whisk in his hand."}
{"text": "3:15 pm."}
{"text": "Their first two dishes are done: egg rolls and golden shrimp balls."}
{"text": "It is also then that Chongyun decides to add himself to the percussion section of whatever song was playing (still on max volume\u2014 much to Xingqiu\u2019s displeasure)."}
{"text": "Xingqiu looks over at him, flabbergasted at his friend\u2019s audacity to take a break when only one-third of the promised menu was done."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you washing your shrimps for your next dish?"}
{"text": "Why are you banging our chopsticks against our wine glasses?\u201d Xingqiu cringes."}
{"text": "Anytime now, and they will crack."}
{"text": "\u201cBecause Xingqiu,\u201d Chongyun quips, voice laced with an \u2018as-a-matter-of-fact\u2019 tone.\u2019 \u201cYou can only reach the various notes with wine glasses.\u201d\nXingqiu sighs in disappointment, unwilling to question any more."}
{"text": "\u201cEr\u2014 well\u2014 glass in general, but we really only have the former.\u201d\n\n5:27 pm."}
{"text": "\u201cTurkey progress?\u201d Xingqiu asked a tad bit too loud (but the still maxed-out music was to blame for his slightly higher-than-normal octave)."}
{"text": "\u201cUh,\u201d Chongyun leans down to the oven, checking for the remaining time."}
{"text": "\u201cHalf\u2026 an hour?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, half an hour\u2014 that is\u2014 if we don\u2019t mess it up,\u201d he double-takes."}
{"text": "\u201cWhich I don\u2019t think we will by the way, but yeah."}
{"text": "Just in case.\u201d\n\u201cRight."}
{"text": "Just in case,\u201d Xingqiu echoes in an awfully relaxed manner\u2014 as if Chongyun hadn\u2019t suggested the worst possible outcome for the night."}
{"text": "Xingqiu looks down at their checklist on the counter (something he insisted they needed right after they already got through half the menu)."}
{"text": "\u201cWe still need to make the ice cream and pour the wine,\u201d he scrunches his nose at the list then to the clock overhead, internally noting the little time they have left."}
{"text": "\u201cI can pour the wine,\u201d Chongyun proactively offers, already rummaging through their bottom cabinets, no doubt looking for the finest wine they have to offer."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and get started on the ice cream then, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard anyway.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t jinx it, \u201d Chongyun mutters between a smirk from where he is, standing on tiptoes to reach their highest cabinets (because he couldn\u2019t find the wine in the bottom ones)."}
{"text": "5:55 pm."}
{"text": "\u201cOkay,\u201d Xingqiu says aloud, checklist and pen in his hands."}
{"text": "\u201cWines are poured, turkey nearly ready, ice cream\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou mean cream,\u201d Chongyun corrects from across the counter, whisking the bowl of \u2018ice cream\u2019."}
{"text": "\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018ice\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cWell whisk harder?"}
{"text": "Maybe put it in the freezer?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s now how it works."}
{"text": "If anything, I think I whisked it too hard.\u201d\n\n5:56 pm."}
{"text": "\u201cWe should make it from scratch again,\u201d Xingqiu says hurriedly."}
{"text": "He\u2019s now back in the kitchen, looking through their fridge for any leftover ingredients."}
{"text": "\u201cDammit, we should\u2019ve said 6:30 instead of 6:00\u2026\u201d Chongyun curses under his breath as he puts the bowl of heavily-whipped cream in the sink."}
{"text": "\u201cNot we."}
{"text": "Need I remind you whose fault it was?\u201d Xingqiu says, feeling his anger from 2 days ago resurging."}
{"text": "Xingqiu\u2019s head is still in the fridge before he starts again, \u201cBy the way, we don\u2019t nearly have enough ingredients.\u201d\n\n5:57 pm."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat?"}
{"text": "No, let me check.\u201d\n\u201cI already said we don\u2019t,\u201d Xingqiu slaps Chongyun away from the fridge."}
{"text": "\u201cTake my word.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do then?\u201d\nXingqiu opens the freezer."}
{"text": "\u201cThere\u2019s like\u2026 an unopened box of drumsticks."}
{"text": "We can use them for dessert instead,\u201d he suggests, reaching his hand in the freezer to fumble for it as it was all the way in the back."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know about this unopened box of drumsticks?"}
{"text": "Oh god, is it expired?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026 I take credit for that."}
{"text": "I got it like half a week ago when there were no more popsicles at the market.\u201d\n\n5:58 pm."}
{"text": "The box of drumsticks is now in Xingqiu\u2019s hands."}
{"text": "He works to open the box and take out the content individually, stuffing them back into the freezer for when they will be eaten later."}
{"text": "\u201cStop hovering over me and do something,\u201d he quirks up."}
{"text": "\u201cTake out the turkey and plate it.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\n30 seconds until 6:00 pm."}
{"text": "With all their work done, the pair are now, once again, across the kitchen counter from each other."}
{"text": "Chongyun looks at his roommate checking the last items off their list."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know,\u201d Chongyun starts, leaning and sprawling his hands over to the other side of their small, fake-marble counter."}
{"text": "\u201cFor an informal dinner party, today was pretty stressful.\u201d\nXingqiu hums in affirmation as he slides the completed checklist into the counter drawer."}
{"text": "\u201cBut you know,\u201d Chongyun lightly starts up again, refusing to end their verbal conversation to Xingqiu\u2019s half-response."}
{"text": "\u201cI sort of like it."}
{"text": "The idea of you and me hustling to get everything done.\u201d\nXingqiu looks up."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd I think\u2026\u201d Chongyun looks away for a split second, finding the appropriate words to voice his thoughts with."}
{"text": "\u201cI look forward to the rest of our future."}
{"text": "Like\u2014 graduating, working, living, and growing old\u2026 together.\u201d\nXingqiu holds his eyes."}
{"text": "6:00 pm."}
{"text": "\u201cIs that weird?\u201d Chongyun suddenly doubts himself, releasing their eye contact as he feels a tinge of a blush coming to his cheeks."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean for it to be.\u201d\n\u201cNo."}
{"text": "No, it\u2019s not weird at all,\u201d Xingqiu says, finding his voice (and Chongyun\u2019s eyes) again."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2014 I think I would like that too.\u201d\nTo the reassurance, Chongyun\u2019s smile opens, \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\nAnd for the first time in a while, the navy-blue-haired boy remembers what it means to blush."}
{"text": "Ding."}
{"text": "In which Jack is lost and alone and desperate for something\u2014someone\u2014to attach himself to and Elsa thinks she can undo all the regrets in her life vicariously through others."}
{"text": "Two chairs are across from each other, in the middle of the small (but perfectly sized), teal-walled (but the color seemed fitting), empty (but with a few rare exceptions) room; and when he enters, she\u2019s the only other person there\u2014proud and rich and fitted in her white coat under the harsh, blinding, fluorescent lights\u2014the kinds you see in horror movies\u2014or asylums\u2014he supposes."}
{"text": "A flicker or two and it might as well have been one."}
{"text": "The blistered teal walls have begun to wear and peel long before he started coming here, long before his body neighbor thought that this was what he needed\u2014long before he forgot how to breathe."}
{"text": "He lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding and scrunches his nose when his next inhale holds tinges of weed and cigarettes and yesterday\u2019s patients."}
{"text": "He turns right to her collection and wonders if anything had been added or removed\u2014or replaced."}
{"text": "The shelves are filled with them; three or so rows of thick textbooks\u2014the kind no one likes reading\u2014arranged in a way that made sense only to her."}
{"text": "He squints one more time; Psychology: How to Fix Someone."}
{"text": "Oh, how he hates coming here."}
{"text": "The heater is deafening and there\u2019s a stickiness in the air and he\u2019s already irritated at that, but she makes sure he can hear her."}
{"text": "He parrots back her squeak of a greeting and beelines to his seat\u2014assigned and spotless and centered."}
{"text": "She\u2019s staring at him now\u2014with that expecting look of hers."}
{"text": "I can fix you, it says."}
{"text": "Blink."}
{"text": "Blink, blink."}
{"text": "The overhead lights dim, then flicker."}
{"text": "\u201cSo how\u2019s your day been, Jack?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything fun happening?\u201d She asks."}
{"text": "\u201cNo, not really.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny friends you\u2019re seeing?\u201d She pursues."}
{"text": "\u201cNope, lost touch with them some time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny plans on making new ones?\u201d She\u2019s stubborn."}
{"text": "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need them.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack\u2026\u201d she doesn\u2019t want to surrender."}
{"text": "And really, what the hell is the point of this, even?"}
{"text": "This back and forth is fucking stupid."}
{"text": "She\u2019s trying\u2014he can tell\u2014to fix him."}
{"text": "He thinks she\u2019s going off of some chapter from that stupid book on that stupid shelf of hers."}
{"text": "She has a savior complex like no one else, he knows this."}
{"text": "And he wants to laugh out loud at that: at the fact that she thinks she\u2019s doing some good in the world that\u2019s so much beyond her, that she\u2019s on the same level as Super fucking Man."}
{"text": "He imagines himself standing up, interrupting her tangent on the good of the world and her mantras and promises of how it\u2019ll get better if he would just give it some time."}
{"text": "He imagines himself telling her to stop trying with him and trying with everyone else as if she\u2019s some goddamn saint."}
{"text": "He imagines himself leaving through the door and leaving her hanging, stunned and confused and eyes so wide that the blue was tainted with a subtle hint of red."}
{"text": "But he doesn\u2019t."}
{"text": "He doesn\u2019t and stays glued to his chair like all the other times."}
{"text": "Because no matter how much he\u2019s hated\u2014still hates\u2014it, he knows that it\u2019s a lot better than killing himself."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah?\u201d Even with all his imagined possibilities, he doesn\u2019t have the heart to leave her hanging;\n\nBecause she\u2019s the only one still trying for him; never mind it\u2019s artificiality and the fact that she\u2019s only caring because she has to\u2014because she\u2019s getting paid to."}
{"text": "She\u2019s already known all of his deepest, darkest secrets and everything wrong (and right) about him, but she still takes her time reading him."}
{"text": "He never felt more like an open book."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat you need Jack,\u201d she starts like she\u2019s the almighty."}
{"text": "\u201cIs on the other side of this feeling.\u201d\n\nAnd she almost convinces him she\u2019s one too."}
{"text": "Almost."}
{"text": "\u201cWell no shit, Dr. Arendelle.\u201d\n\nShe gives him a look; a look disapproving of his language and the way he speaks to her."}
{"text": "But she ultimately pushes the rims of her glasses up higher on her nose and sighs."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat do you want, Jack?"}
{"text": "What are you looking for, what is one thing you want right now.\u201d\n\nHis eyes narrow and his lips thin."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know what I want, Doctor."}
{"text": "You\u2019ve known it since the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack, you know I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what the hell else did you mean?"}
{"text": "You asked me what I wanted,\u201d He was starting to lose himself and he wasn\u2019t quite sure whose fault it was; hers for being so damn wise and all knowing and vague with him, or his for being so uncooperative and impatient with her."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd I answered."}
{"text": "I fucking answered."}
{"text": "What the fuck else do you want from me Doctor?\u201d\n\nShe stares at him like he\u2019s lost it."}
{"text": "\u201cOr was I too vague for you?\u201d Then, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, let me be more clear.\u201d\n\nHe enunciates the word \u2018clear\u2019 so well that he is sure no one had done it better."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, Doctor,\u201d he leans forward, getting as close to her as he can and stares her dead in the eyes."}
{"text": "Blue on blue."}
{"text": "\u201cThe thing I want most right now, is to travel back in time and fix everything."}
{"text": "To redo everything I did wrong and fucking fix every regret I have.\u201d\n\nHe expects her usual: a stare and sigh and some wise mumbo jumbo nonsense she probably has saved at the back of that smart head of hers to recycle on her patients who were all going through the same damn thing as him."}
{"text": "Really, Jack is aware his situation is not special."}
{"text": "That he\u2019s just another sad person who lost his family in some tragic way and can\u2019t seem to get his life right ever since."}
{"text": "Not like he ever tried."}
{"text": "He more or less died the same time they did."}
{"text": "Difference is, he\u2019s just not six feet under yet."}
{"text": "But the last thing he expects from the dignified woman across from him was a snort, a hand to her mouth,\n\nAnd a display of hysteria."}
{"text": "She laughs as if she'd just heard the funniest fucking joke in the whole goddamn world, and he smiles awkwardly as if he just didn't fucking yell at her."}
{"text": "Chapter 2: another day,\n\nThe next time he sees her is Wednesday."}
{"text": "They were back in her small, teal office."}
{"text": "But instead of 2 chairs across from each other, it was 5 arranged in a circle."}
{"text": "Jack is the first to arrive."}
{"text": "\u201cHow\u2019s your day, Jack?\u201d She asks as if their Monday session didn\u2019t happen at all."}
{"text": "He sucks in his cheeks and searched his brain for a response."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 good.\u201d\n\nShe opens her mouth and laughs a little, \u201cFor some reason, I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d \n\nHe returns a small smile, \u201cWell Doctor, it could\u2019ve been better I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\nAnd before she can find something else to talk about or he can reply or before the awkwardness fully engulfs the both of them, the others trickle in; one by one by one."}
{"text": "\u201cHow\u2019s everyone been since last week?\u201d she asks, tone laced with a little too much enthusiasm and made-up excitement and\u2014dare he say\u2014boredom and tiredness."}
{"text": "Sometimes he thinks she just doesn\u2019t care at all\u2014about any of them or\u2014quite frankly\u2014anything."}
{"text": "But he convinced himself he was making stuff up some time ago."}
{"text": "She\u2019s a wannabe saint after all, so why would she pretend?"}
{"text": "Bunny usually starts."}
{"text": "\u201cActually life\u2019s been looking up, Doc.\u201d\n\nThis piques his interest."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s amazing Aster!\u201d She ushers for him to go on."}
{"text": "\u201cI met this girl,\u201d he starts in a singsong type of way\u2014if  one heard him talk, they would know he was already falling for her."}
{"text": "\u201cActually, we\u2019ve known each other already\u2014\u201c he laughs."}
{"text": "\u201cShe\u2019s been my dentist for the last 2 years or so.\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s eyes widen a bit and he digs his fingers through his jeans and into his thighs to keep himself from snorting out loud."}
{"text": "This is by far, single-handedly, hands down, their most interesting group session yet."}
{"text": "\u201cBut recently, we got a chance to talk to each other outside of the office and\u2014well\u2014\u201c he was tapping his feet, a sign he was antsy or nervous or excited or maybe it was a little bit of everything."}
{"text": "\u201cWe really hit it off.\u201d\n\nShe smiles and he could see how white and straight and perfect her teeth were."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s amazing Aster, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d\n\nAster smiled."}
{"text": "\u201cThanks Doc.\u201d\n\nAnd Jack has a feeling that he wouldn\u2019t see Aster at all soon, very very soon."}
{"text": "And then he wonders; was that all it took to get them out of this hellhole?"}
{"text": "To make the world around them think they\u2019re all better and happy and no longer drowning in their feelings and emotions and nonexistent expectations?"}
{"text": "Was all it took a girl?"}
{"text": "Cause if that\u2019s the case, then he should go look for one; he\u2019s been told that he\u2019s quite the looker after all."}
{"text": "\u201cAnyone else have something fun to share before we begin?\u201d She tries again."}
{"text": "She always opens their sessions with the simple questions."}
{"text": "Jack figures most people can give a simple or one word answer like him, but he started to notice that a few of them start opening up some more over the past few weeks or so."}
{"text": "Maybe they just want to leave this shitty place, he guesses."}
{"text": "Or maybe she\u2019s changing them."}
{"text": "\u201cI moved back in with my parents,\u201d Rapunzel says, all cheery and happy and excited for her new life."}
{"text": "He wants to join in with the others and smile and congratulate and be excited for her, but instead, he caughts himself biting his gums and thinning his lips and looking down at his hands\u2014open and pale and at his mercy."}
{"text": "Because deep down, he\u2019s jealous."}
{"text": "Jealous and saddened and annoyed that he can\u2019t\u2014never again\u2014have what she has."}
{"text": "He wants to scream at that."}
{"text": "But instead he shoots her a small smile, pained and faint and a little bit sincere."}
{"text": "Really he is happy for her."}
{"text": "Because from their couple or so therapy sessions together\u2014ever since he joined them\u2014he knows she had had family trauma."}
{"text": "She deserves it, he thinks to himself."}
{"text": "He makes out her chatter from the other\u2019s."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you!\u201d \n\nEventually the happiness dies down and Jack is relieved at that but then\u2014\n\n\u201cI got into the school my brother went to,\u201d Hiro adds to the group\u2019s little jar of shared happiness and good news."}
{"text": "Another series of applause and congratulations rotates around the group like clockwork; starting from her."}
{"text": "And then a little while later:\n\n\u201cAnything from you, Jack?\u201d Aster asks, all well-intentioned and unintentional, but unaware."}
{"text": "Painfully unaware."}
{"text": "Jack thinks Doctor Arendelle is a lucky person for having three good\u2014amazing even\u2014news from her patients when it just so happens to be the day of their group session."}
{"text": "But he knows she isn\u2019t that lucky."}
{"text": "Because she went three for four."}
{"text": "Jack shrugs and hums a light no."}
{"text": "Because after everyone\u2019s contribution to their imagined happiness jar, he doesn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t be\u2014the guy to ruin their streak."}
{"text": "He\u2019s a sad person, he knows, but not a bad one."}
{"text": "\u201cAwe\u2026 well\u2014\u201c Rapunzel starts but can\u2019t finish."}
{"text": "He doesn\u2019t blame her."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s fine guys,\u201d she speaks up again to drive their attention to anywhere but him."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s about time we move on to the next part of our agenda.\u201d\n\nHe makes eye contact with her and gives her a small grateful smile."}
{"text": "She nods in return."}
{"text": "Jack closes his eyes and sinks into his chair as the people around him start to talk and listen, and talk some more."}
{"text": "And his mind travels to that day, the day he lost himself."}
{"text": "He\u2019s back to a winter he can\u2019t seem to forget."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cJack!\u201d Emily yells at him from an arm\u2019s length away."}
{"text": "\u201cGive me some!\u201d\n\nHe laughs and pokes her nose and blows a raspberry at her."}
{"text": "\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAnd Emily is going to cry\u2014he knows it\u2014her eyebrows are knitted together and her nose is scrunched."}
{"text": "\u201cI hat\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cWhat are you two doing back there?\u201d Their mom turns around from her shotgun seat."}
{"text": "\u201cNothi\u2014\u201c\n\nJack is quick, but she still interrupts him."}

{"text": "\u201cWell the session\u2019s been over and Jack\u2019s fine so I think it\u2019s about time we wrap up.\u201d \n\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Aster jumps in and checks his wristwatch."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m almost late for a meeting because of this.\u201d \n \nAnd then he looks over at Jack, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault though, mate.\u201d \n\nJack nods, in skepticism and confusion and everything in between."}

{"text": "\u201cAre you okay, Jack?\u201d She asks him, justifiably concerned."}
{"text": "It gives him hope that she was concerned\u2014even if it was only pretending."}
{"text": "He sucks in the air and holds onto his next breath."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d And he clasps his hands together and hopes she doesn\u2019t notice them glistening with sweat."}
{"text": "He wonders if his face still holds signs of sweat too."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem convinced but doesn\u2019t pry either."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d He tries to reassure her\u2014or at least tell her that everything\u2019s fine and that she shouldn\u2019t worry and bother with him."}
{"text": "\u201cI see.\u201d She smiles a dull smile and accepts his proclamation."}
{"text": "\u201cAt the end of the day, you know yourself best after all.\u201d\n\nHe thins his lips and, \u201cYep, thanks for the concern though Doctor.\u201d \n\nShe bites hers."}
{"text": "\u201cNo problem, Jackson.\u201d\n\nHe walks out the door and notices it was twenty past seven\u2014twenty past their session hours;\n\nNo wonder she doesn\u2019t give a shit about him."}
{"text": "Chapter 3: an evening,\n\nThe next time he sees her is at a restaurant, him, ordering sushi for takeout, and her, eating by herself at the bar area."}

{"text": "She turns and sees him first;\n\n\u201cHi Jack!\u201d An airy greeting followed by a subtle flick of the hand."}
{"text": "He sucks in the cold, chilled, air around him."}
{"text": "He smiles back\u2014holding onto his last thread of common courtesy and human kindness and frankly, \u2018because his mother didn\u2019t raise him to be a dick\u2019\u2014but doesn\u2019t echo her greeting."}
{"text": "For what felt like an eternity in the waiting area, the waitress finally hands him his order of takeout."}
{"text": "He\u2019s thanking her as his head curses her for taking so goddamn long and he\u2019s about to leave when\u2014\n\n\u201cJack!\u201d she calls him in between a laugh and waves at him to come over."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know her?\u201d The waitress asks him, giving him a look he can\u2019t quite seem to figure out."}
{"text": "He wants to shrug but nods reluctantly instead."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah\u2026 sorta.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s my psychiatrist."}
{"text": "He finishes in his head."}
{"text": "The waitress lets out a relieved sigh and beckons him to come closer."}
{"text": "He obliges."}
{"text": "\u201cThe woman had had a lot to drink already,\u201d she starts."}
{"text": "He wonders what about him made her think he gave two shits about said woman."}
{"text": "But he bites his lips and swallows back a groan and curls his toes in his shoes and into the ground to prevent himself from simply walking away with his only meal of the day."}
{"text": "\u201cActually, truth be told\u2026\u201d he senses the woman\u2019s hesitancy."}
{"text": "\u201cPeople have been complaining about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d and he\u2019s starting to understand where the woman is going with this."}
{"text": "He can tell it from the way she speaks to him, the way she looks at him, the way she crouches so he seems a lot taller than he is compared to her\u2014the way she submisses to him."}
{"text": "\u201cIs it okay if she goes home with you?\u201d\n\nHe blinks in disbelief at her request."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t\u2014\u201c he stops midway to look over at the woman of topic\u2014who\u2019s slumped over her chair and mumbling some mumbo jumbo to the sorry person two seats away from her."}
{"text": "He sucks down an incoming hiss, \u201cShe\u2019s not with anyone\u2014anyone at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d The woman ponders for a bit before replying, \u201cThere was a man.\u201d\n\nHe smiles."}
{"text": "\u201cMaybe ask him instead then, yeah?\u201d\n\nThe waitress bites her lips."}
{"text": "\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\nHe was starting to lose his patience at her tippy-toeing around their conversation."}
{"text": "\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe left her here\u2026 with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\n\nJack doesn\u2019t know how he feels\u2014or quite frankly\u2014how he should feel; a part of him feels terrible for her, but another part doesn\u2019t really care."}
{"text": "And another feels like she deserved it."}
{"text": "And really, that was just his pettiness speaking because at the end of the day; she was just doing her job, trying her best to talk to him and understand and fix him."}
{"text": "And really, it was his fault for believing she could."}
{"text": "He lets out a defeated sigh and surrenders himself."}
{"text": "\u201cSure."}
{"text": "But you guys owe me a meal the next time I visit.\u201d\n\nThe woman smiles and writes his name down for next time, \u201cJack."}
{"text": "right?\u201d\n\nHe nods."}
{"text": "She tucks a stray strand of hair behind her ear and smiles warmly at him; he notices the formation of pink on her cheeks."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a nice name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks\u2026?\u201d He looks at her weirdly, completely aware of her attempts at him but scrambles to do what he said he would."}
{"text": "He waves awkwardly with the hand free of food and walks over to the oblivious girl at the bar a few feet away from him."}
{"text": "\u201cSee ya.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you next time, Jack.\u201d\n\n~~~\n\n\u201cDoctor Arendelle.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d she sucks in her breath."}
{"text": "\u201cIs it morning already?"}
{"text": "!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctor Arendelle!\u201d The voice speaks again, this time followed by a gentle shake of her shoulders."}
{"text": "\u201cAnna?\u201d Elsa giggles, eyes half-closed."}
{"text": "\u201cIs that you?\u201d Then she slumps over again, \u201cWhy are you calling me that name?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work, is it?\u201d The voice\u2014the voice of a man\u2014 grumbles."}
{"text": "She hears a light sigh and the next thing she knew, her face stopped flirting with the table and she was in the arms of someone whose voice her ears recognize but her mind can\u2019t seem to comprehend."}
{"text": "At least he smells nice."}
{"text": "Chapter 4: A night spent together\n\nThis is crazy."}
{"text": "Jack thinks."}
{"text": "You\u2019re fucking crazy."}
{"text": "He curses himself."}
{"text": "If someone told Jack this morning that he would soon have Doctor fucking Arendelle in his bed the same random Tuesday night, he would tell you you were crazy\u2014or high, or both\u2014and slap you in the face."}
{"text": "Hard."}
{"text": "Cause really, he would\u2019ve thought you were crazy and that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014you needed more professional help than he did."}
{"text": "That fact, in itself, was crazy."}
{"text": "But here he is, Jackson Overland Frost, sitting in nothing but his boxers and sweats, chopsticks in one hand and sushi plate in another\u2014afraid that the next bite would wake her up\u2014and Doctor Arendelle\u2014his fucking psychiatrist\u2014laying in his bed, in her night blue, skin-tight, dress, in his studio apartment, in the far corner, restlessly moving and shoving and kicking around in his sheets."}
{"text": "She was ingraining her scent all over them."}
{"text": "He fights the urge to punch himself and scolds his mind for ever thinking\u2014ever letting himself think\u2014that."}
{"text": "\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d\n\nHe freezes and feels his palms sweat and clings onto his plate for dear life because\u2014\n\nBecause if the damn fucking plate drops\u2026 his life may as well have been over."}
{"text": "Jack then sees his psychiatrist try to lift herself up from his bed and he swears he almost pissed his pants."}
{"text": "\u201cWhere am I?\u201d \n\nHe hears her faintly mumble to herself, voice a little shaky and disgruntled, and everything in between."}
{"text": "He tries his best to stay still and unnoticed but she still senses him there."}
{"text": "\u201cIs there someone else here?\u201d\n\nIt must\u2019ve been her sixth psychiatrist-related sense; mindreading or something, he assumes."}
{"text": "\u201cI know you\u2019re there.\u201d He hears her shuffling around a bit more."}
{"text": "Yup, mindreading for sure."}
{"text": "He lets out the breath he was holding and steps into the moonlight shining through his window and surrenders himself to her."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2018Sup,\u201d was all he could say."}
{"text": "In the light, he catches sight of her eyes squinting\u2014probably to fix her vision on him and make out the mystery man."}
{"text": "\u201cJack?\u201d she questions."}
{"text": "She\u2019s fucking psychic, he concludes."}
{"text": "\u201cThe one and only,\u201d he responds as he steps closer to her\u2014to his bed."}
{"text": "He knew she\u2019s intoxicated and heavily under the influence right now, but he still treks with caution."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s so unbelievably\u2026\u201d she starts and wiggles around in his sheets, further cementing her scent onto his territory."}
{"text": "\u201cHot\u2026\u201d \n\nHe can see her fidgeting around, struggling to do something."}
{"text": "He couldn\u2019t quite yet tell what though."}
{"text": "\u201cJack,\u201d she starts."}
{"text": "\u201cHm?\u201d His eyes wander all over her body, and he hates his conscience for stopping his gaze at her breasts; they were more voluptuous than he initially thought\u2014but to be fair, the dress left little for imagination while her lab coat hid them well."}
{"text": "His throat runs cold as he notices a bead of sweat on her right mound."}
{"text": "He\u2019s more than fucked."}
{"text": "\u201cStop standing there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome and help get this dress off of me.\u201d She groans and sways back and forth as he notices her hands wander\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d He gasps and stops himself from saying anything more and just stands there, a few feet away from his bed."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d She starts her drunk rambles."}
{"text": "\u201cFor someone as fucking hot as you\u2014\u201d and tugs at the top of her tube dress."}
{"text": "A sweat trickles down his forehead and he gulps as he claws his wet fists deep into the pockets of his gray sweatpants."}
{"text": "He was starting to get hot too."}
{"text": "It must\u2019ve been the temperature that was bothering the both of them."}
{"text": "He should probably stop her."}
{"text": "\u201cDoctor\u2014\u201d\n\nShe sighs the sigh to end all sighs\u2014a little exaggerated, extremely dramatic, and royally sassy, \u201cAgain with that title."}
{"text": "Didn\u2019t I tell you before, Jack?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d He wiggles his fingers in his pockets in hopes of wiping some of the sweat away."}
{"text": "\u201cTell me what, exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo call me Elsa.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\nShe stops and stares at him for a little bit\u2014a little too long for his comfort but a little too short to deem her a creep\u2014and proceeds to shrug."}
{"text": "\u201cWell\u2014maybe in my dreams I did.\u201d She mumbles the last part."}
{"text": "But it was a little past midnight, and with the streets\u2014though they were nineteen floors below them\u2014quiet, devoid of the typical road-raging driver and angry honks, it was hard not to hear her."}
{"text": "He gulps for about the tenth time that night."}
{"text": "\u201cOh\u2014\u201d And even though she\u2019s drunk and probably won\u2019t remember anything a few hours from now, he\u2019s still at a loss for the right words to say to the woman before him."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2014I see.\u201d\n\nHe keeps his gaze on her as she (still) tries to strip herself."}
{"text": "He winces."}
{"text": "\u201cI don\u2019t think you should do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\nAnd with that damned look on her face\u2014he finds it a little bit hard to not lose himself."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re already half naked,\u201d she comments and then giggles\u2014like a fucking schoolgirl."}
{"text": "\u201cSo really, what\u2019s wrong, Jack?\u201d\u2019\n\nHe finds himself gulping for the hundredth (but really it must\u2019ve been the eleventh) time that night\u2014which he should probably stop doing because he was already dehydrated."}
{"text": "Elsa has a look on her face now, probably annoyed at his response (or lack of)."}
{"text": "\u201cStop standing there,\u201d she beckons for him."}
{"text": "\u201cHow many more times do I have to ask?\u201d \n\nDrawn in by her voice in the middle of the night, with his mind too tired to fight back, and his heart, beating wildly and threatening to roll right out of his chest, Jack walks over."}
{"text": "Chapter 5: a morning after,\n\nThe first thing Elsa does when she wakes up is groan to herself."}
{"text": "Her head spins at a pace where her conscience can\u2019t keep up."}
{"text": "She rubs her hand on the sheet, once, twice\u2014and her eyebrows furrow into each other."}
{"text": "The blanket is a lot softer and thinner than what she\u2019s used to every morning."}
{"text": "When her brain finally catches up, she realizes that this isn\u2019t even her blanket."}
{"text": "Nor is this her bed\u2014or her damn room."}
{"text": "And then all at once, a feeling of pure, utter dread hits."}
{"text": "All of a sudden, she\u2019s sober again."}
{"text": "Now her mind does another frantic dance with itself, trying to figure out that\u2014if this isn\u2019t her room (nor is it Anna\u2019s) or Hans for that matter\u2014then who did the room belong to?"}
{"text": "She looks down at herself, her arm still tugging the thin blanket across her chest, and winces prematurely when she carefully opens it to reveal the rest of her body."}
{"text": "To her relief, she was still in the same dress she left her house wearing last night\u2014for the most part."}
{"text": "She takes a deep breath and then her wide blue eyes look; she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s looking for\u2014hell she isn\u2019t even sure if she wants to know\u2014but she does so anyway because that\u2019s, quite honestly, the most logical thing she could do given her situation."}
{"text": "But, for good measure, she pinches herself just to make sure she\u2019s awake and that this is her reality."}
{"text": "(It is.)"}
{"text": "When her eyes make it sixty percent across the room, she hears the person rather than sees them."}
{"text": "\u201cFinally awake?\u201d A cool, crisp, almost teasing, voice startles her investigation."}
{"text": "Her heart stops, and her face twists further into itself when she realizes\u2014recognizes\u2014who the voice belongs to."}
{"text": "\u201cJackson?\u201d She throws out randomly, not looking at him and crossing her fingers, hoping, that this was just someone who just happened to sound like her fucking patient."}
{"text": "\u201cAt your service, Doctor Arendelle.\u201d He gets up from the couch he was sitting at in his studio apartment and puts his coffee down, stretching."}
{"text": "Motherfucking stretching."}
{"text": "She curses out, earning an ingenuine chuckle from the dreadful man."}
{"text": "\u201cDid\u2014\u201d she points between them, frantic and awkward and hoping."}
{"text": "\u201cDid something happen between us?\u201d\n\nThis earns a laugh from him."}
{"text": "At the end of it, she hears a funny \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nShe must\u2019ve had some doubts on her face, because he says some more, \u201cI can one hundred percent assure you, Doctor, that our relationship as patient and doctor did not\u2014and probably will not\u2014cross that line.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen\u2026\u201d she sucks in a breath and asks another terribly unprofessional question."}
{"text": "\u201cThen how\u2026 how did I get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lady at the sushi restaurant more or less made you my problem,\u201d he says, trying his best to make it seem like it is nothing to him\u2014but from her experience as his psychiatrist, she knows."}
{"text": "\u201cApparently the man you were with left\u2026 and never came back.\u201d \n\nWhen she doesn\u2019t say anything and takes the time to process, he adds, \u201cYou can ask her\u2014if you doubt me\u2014I wouldn\u2019t take offense to that.\u201d \n\nWhen he feels the need to explain and give himself an alibi, she only shakes her head, guiltily."}
{"text": "She fucked up."}
{"text": "\u201cOh my god, Jackson\u2026\u201d her eyes widen more when they finally, actually look at him."}

{"text": "How terribly unpro\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cLike I said, Doctor Arendelle.\u201d \n\nShe winces at his title for her and resists the very strong urge to slap herself."}
{"text": "Because this was so not happening."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem."}
{"text": "I don\u2019t mind helping you out, and you shouldn\u2019t either, just take this gesture as something any acquaintance would do,\u201d he says too cheerily and nonchalantly and for once in her life, she needs to stop psychoanalyzing him."}

{"text": "\u201cYes, Bunny, it\u2019s only the day I hear back from the job of the century, Bunny!"}
{"text": "A TA, imagine that!\u201d\nA sigh comes from his phone, \u201cDid they at least tell you what time you\u2019ll hear back?\u201d\nJack shrugs, but it\u2019s not like Bunny can see him."}
{"text": "\u201cNope.\u201d He pops his p. \u201cOnly that it\u2019ll be today.\u201d\nAnother sigh, and then silence."}
{"text": "\u201cLike me next to you, and you next to me~and you next to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI said to shut up.\u201d\n\u201cTurn me down?\u201d\n\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you when you say something important.\u201d\nJack wants to laugh, \u201cWhen have I ever said something important?\u201d\nA silence, and then, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cI always am,\u201d a satisfied smile forms on his lips, even though he\u2019s the only one to know."}
{"text": "\u201cStill, I mean it, Jackson, if you want me to stay on the phone with you, stop singing\u2014at least not so damn loud\u2014I\u2019m trying to get this problem set done.\u201d\nJack turns on his right blinker, successfully switches lane, and has just gotten off the freeway exit when he replies again, \u201cYes dad.\u201d\nHe\u2019s at a stoplight now, right blinker still on, waiting to turn."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m telling Toothi\u2014\u201c\nHONKKKK."}
{"text": "\u201cOh\u2014fuck."}
{"text": "Shit!\u201d\n\nAnd then Aster hears a loud and deafening beeeep."}
{"text": "His head hurts."}
{"text": "Everything kind of sort of hurts."}
{"text": "There\u2019s a slight ringing in his ears and he isn\u2019t sure where it\u2019s coming from."}
{"text": "\u201cOwowowow\u2014\u201c he winces in pain as he fights the inflated airbag and his seatbelt and the door, all at once."}
{"text": "\u201cOh my god!\u201d\nThrough all the ringing he\u2019s hearing\u2014or imagining\u2014an angelic voice makes it through to him."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d It says."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you okay?\u201d It says."}
{"text": "\u201cDoes it hurt anymore?\u201d A pair of thin arms helps itself to him, wrapping themselves around him."}
{"text": "\u201cShit, I should call the cops\u2026\u201d the voice says to no one in particular, him maybe but he\u2019s in a state where he isn\u2019t even sure if it\u2019s real."}
{"text": "Once he\u2019s out, he stumbles around a bit, but the same pair of arms help him find his balance, sitting him on the road against his car."}
{"text": "His mind is slow."}
{"text": "But it soon catches up."}
{"text": "And he looks up."}
{"text": "A pair of eyes so blue and bright looks at him\u2014they dart all over him."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah,\u201d he manages to say when words find their way back to him, when his brain finally processes everything."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d \nHe looks around him and takes the rest of the scene in."}
{"text": "The front of his car is fine."}
{"text": "The back, however, isn\u2019t as much\u2014in fact\u2014a fucking Bentley, is kissing its ass."}
{"text": "His trunk is open, probably from the impact, and he sees what looks to be a dent: noticeable, but it won\u2019t cost a leg and arm to repair."}
{"text": "He cringes when he notices the condition of its ass kisser though."}
{"text": "The Bentley has a lot\u2014too much\u2014scratches and dents all over it."}
{"text": "He squints and he even sees a faint cloud of steam coming from under its hood."}
{"text": "His eyes then trail to the girl hovering over him, and words are hard again, but by some miraculous nature, he manages, \u201cThe Bentley\u2026 maybe not as fine.\u201d\nThen, despite the tragedy and unfortunate circumstance of the situation, \u201cBattle scars are sexy, but not on a Bentley,\u201d he quips."}
{"text": "(But it\u2019s more done out of a habit\u2014Jack defaults to humor when he doesn\u2019t know what the fuck else to do)."}
{"text": "And, with the combination of the accident, a pretty girl, the state of his car, and the state of her car (the terrible, terrible tragedy), he finds himself a sitting duck."}
{"text": "Helpless and staring."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she says."}
{"text": "\u201cStay here while I call the cops\u2014and my parents\u2014\u201c\nHe notices the tapping of her baby blue kitten heels."}
{"text": "\u201cOh god, what would they think\u2014say?"}
{"text": "!\u201d\nDespite being on the ground, and still a little dazed, he finds it in himself to console her worried self, \u201cRelax, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand.\u201d And then he takes a look at the Bentley, \u201cTo some extent.\u201d\nThe girl turns to look at him, her phone in one hand, mid-dial."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d\nHe shakes his head, but in the middle of doing so, he\u2019s racking his brain for the memories, \u201cI was making a right turn\u2026\u201d he thinks out loud."}
{"text": "\u201cTurning on a green\u2026\u201d\nHis mouth morphs into a silent \u2018o\u2019 as he looks at her again, eyes slightly wide."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah,\u201d she nods, lips thinning into a frown."}
{"text": "Her eyebrows are knitted together as she confesses, \u201cIt was my fault\u2026 I was\u2014\u201c\nHe waits patiently for her truth."}
{"text": "\u201cGoing a little too fast.\u201d Then for no other reason (because she isn\u2019t obligated to tell him the details), \u201cI was going sixty."}
{"text": "On a twenty-five.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know what to say."}
{"text": "I see?"}
{"text": "Nope, the conversation would die\u2014and it\u2019ll get awkward, he doesn\u2019t want it to get awkward, because they\u2019re stuck with each other until the cops come\u2014and god knows how long that\u2019ll be."}
{"text": "Yup, your fault."}
{"text": "No, just no."}
{"text": "So he settles with just staring at her, waiting for her to call the cops, explain the situation to them:\n\u201cAccident, yes."}
{"text": "Between Towne and its freeway exit, yes."}
{"text": "Hold on\u2014\u201c\nShe turns to him, who\u2019s still on the ground."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you have your driver\u2019s license?\u201d \nHe nods."}
{"text": "\u201cInsurance?\u201d \nHe points to his car behind him, nodding."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, we both do,\u201d she returns back to the call."}
{"text": "\u201cOkay, thank you so much.\u201d \nBeep."}
{"text": "\u201cThat was the cops,\u201d she explains to him\u2014probably because he was staring at her the entire damn fucking time."}
{"text": "\u201cI see\u2026\u201d He stands up, stumbles a bit, rejects her help, and continues  on, as cool as he can."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat are you going to tell your parents?\u201d\nShe sighs, \u201cThe truth.\u201d \nA short silence befalls the both of them before he pursues, \u201cWhy were you going so fast?\u201d\n\u201cI was,\u201d a tinge of pink covers her cheeks."}
{"text": "\u201cLate to class.\u201d\nHe blinks and tries\u2014let it be known he really really tried\u2014his best to hold in his laugh, but he fails."}
{"text": "And it comes running out of his lips."}
{"text": "The girl is left standing there, speechless and most definitely\u2014justifiably\u2014shocked at what\u2019s happening."}
{"text": "Her eyebrows fold even tighter into each other by the time he pulls himself together."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he apologizes."}
{"text": "\u201cI wasn\u2019t laughing at your reason, I was just\u2014I just\u2014\u201c\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that?\u201d She finishes for him."}
{"text": "He nods."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah.\u201d\nBefore she gets a chance to respond to him, they hear the distant sirens of the police."}
{"text": "\u201cName?\u201d\nJack leans against his car as he looks at the girl and the policeman responsible for getting her details."}
{"text": "He had already been talked to, by another policeman, who\u2019s to the side, writing some things down."}
{"text": "He plays with the gumwrap in the pocket of his favorite hoodie, twisting and twirling it around his fingers as he listens in on them (not because he\u2019s creepy, but because he has nothing else to do, waiting\u2014he already found time to respond to Bunny\u2019s frantic texts)."}
{"text": "Awe, you do care, were the last words he typed and answered to his anxious friend."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa."}
{"text": "Elsa Arendelle.\u201d\nThat name sounds familiar."}
{"text": "Eventually, Triple A comes, they figure out how much they owe him, the cops leave, and AAA leaves with her car\u2014they told him that there were no fatal damages to his Camry and that it was fine and that fixes would only be for cosmetic purposes (to which he vehemently denied the need for, and which everyone agreed) and his trunk closed properly so all was well."}
{"text": "Except for the nervous beating of his heart, because 1) he realizes who she is: a rich heiress at the same university, in the same damn year as him, and 2) it\u2019s just the two of them now."}
{"text": "When he glances over at her, she\u2019s looking down at her phone, fingers flying across her screen at probably two-hundred words per minute, texting\u2014probably her sister, now that he knows who the fuck she is."}
{"text": "\u201cSo\u2026\u201d he starts, waiting for her attention."}
{"text": "He continues when he gets it, \u201cWant a ride?"}
{"text": "I was heading back to school too.\u201d\nShe blinks, confused for a split second, but then realization finds her face."}
{"text": "\u201cYou go to Northton?\u201d\nHe nods, \u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d she says and follows him as he opens the passenger seat for her."}
{"text": "For some reason, he can tell she\u2019s not entirely present."}
{"text": "If it was bothering him, then Jack doesn\u2019t dare voice it out loud as he wraps around to the driver\u2019s seat, gets in, and closes the door."}
{"text": "They sit in silence for the entirety of the five-minute ride (because they were that close to making it back with no mishaps)."}
{"text": "Jack\u2019s right blinkers are on as he begins his turn into the campus parking lot when\u2014\n\u201cFinally, I remember!\u201d Elsa physically jumps in her seat from his peripheral."}
{"text": "And then she turns to him,\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jackson Overland, right?\u201d"}
{"text": "\nTick."}
{"text": "Tick."}
{"text": "Tick."}
{"text": "\u201cSo what are your bad habits?\u201d The white-haired man leans further back into his bean bag as he tries his best to undo the much-too-tight knot at the base of his tie."}
{"text": "He tells himself he should remind Tooth to not tie it so damn fucking tight next time."}
{"text": "But he knows their conversation is going to end with her annoying boyfriend scolding him in his annoying Aussie accent."}
{"text": "\u2018Be grateful you jerk.\u2019\n\nOr, \u2018Have your nonexistent girlfriend do it for you next time.\u2019 \n\n\u201cUhm\u2026 Mister?\u201d The strawberry blonde woman calls out to him, from across his makeshift office."}
{"text": "But really they\u2019re just in the living room, with a mahogany coffee table, low enough for him to use it as a leg prop, separating the woman\u2014who\u2019s on the relatively old, relatively soft, couch\u2014and him\u2014on the bean bag he dragged out of his room to do this meeting comfortably on."}
{"text": "It\u2019s at her call that he remembers he\u2019s supposed to be interviewing her for the (most covetable) position as his roommate."}
{"text": "He\u2019s been a sitting duck, struggling to pay rent ever since his former roommate, Hiccup, had left him to live with his girlfriend."}
{"text": "Like is he fucking kidding?"}
{"text": "He\u2019d rather live with his girlfriend than his best friend?"}
{"text": "Really, Jack doesn\u2019t understand at all."}
{"text": "(And his friends tell him he never will, but if asked he would say he has no idea what they\u2019re talking about because he\u2014as much as his friends say otherwise\u2014has rizz.)"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I,\u201d he coughs to seem busy and tries to gather his thoughts."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat were you saying again?"}
{"text": "What was I asking again?\u201d\n\nThe young woman blinks and starts to get up, \u201cYou know what, this isn\u2019t going to work\u2014Elsa, my sister\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cYour sister?\u201d Jack mirrors her motion and gets up as well."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat about her?"}
{"text": "And why is she brought up again?\u201d \n\nReal mature, Jack."}
{"text": "Real fucking mature."}
{"text": "\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m actually interviewing for her because she couldn\u2019t make it today\u2026\u201d Anna sends him a small smile before leaning down again to grab her purse on the low table between them."}
{"text": "\u201cBut you know\u2026 she\u2019s very\u2026\u201d she looks around for a bit, refusing to make eye contact with Jack."}
{"text": "\u201cSpecific about the people she wants to live with.\u201d\n\nJack blinks in confusion."}
{"text": "\u201cSo I\u2019m sorr\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Realization dawns on him as he finally catches hold of the pity on his interviewee\u2019s face."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you\u2026 rejecting me?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the person I\u2019m interviewing?\u201d\n\nAnna gives him a scared look and she mouths a weak, silent, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019."}
{"text": "For whatever reason, she decides to stand there though."}
{"text": "Maybe because she regrets getting up on him or maybe because she\u2019s a really nice girl and can\u2019t fathom the idea of leaving him hanging."}
{"text": "\u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re interviewing in place of your sister\u2026 Elsa, right?\u201d Jack tries again with her."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry that was\u2014I was just lost in my thoughts for a bit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n(And despite apologizing, he lowkey thinks she\u2019s a little bit crazy for deciding that living with him was a bad idea because he zoned out a smidge.)"}
{"text": "Just a smidge."}
{"text": "\u201cOh no worries, I wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d she tells him as if she has access to his thoughts."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014my sister\u2026 Elsa\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cElsa\u2026\u201d Jack repeats after her, urging her to go on about the reason\u2014the person\u2014why she almost leaves him hanging for."}
{"text": "(He\u2019s totally aware that this isn\u2019t a date or whatever though, or even close to one at all, but still)."}
{"text": "But still\u2026\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 mmm,\u201d Anna\u2019s thinking really hard."}
{"text": "\u201cHow do I say this\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t be that bad, right?\u201d And really, does he want to know?"}
{"text": "What if it\u2019s something really bad or really gross or really\u2026 wait what if she\u2019s a fucking murderer or something."}
{"text": "Maybe he should just let the woman leave."}
{"text": "\u201cNo!\u201d Anna shouts to save her sister\u2019s reputation."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking it is.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s convinced she\u2019s a mind reader."}
{"text": "\u201cThen what is it?\u201d He asks casually, hoping she doesn\u2019t catch a glimpse of his sweaty palms or hear the waver in his voice."}
{"text": "\u201cShe\u2019s just very\u2026 proper."}
{"text": "Prim."}
{"text": "Sophisticated, elegant, technical\u2026 clean\u2026\u201d\n\nJack can\u2019t decide if she\u2019s insulting him or if she means it."}
{"text": "He finds the latter hard to believe though, because how can anyone really be all that?"}
{"text": "If he didn\u2019t know better and if they weren\u2019t living in the 21st century, he\u2019d have thought she was describing a queen."}
{"text": "But he can\u2019t give this Elsa person up either, because\u2014 quite frankly\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to be living off of instant ramen and pizza anymore."}
{"text": "Quite frankly, he kind of wants to enjoy his weekends not alone and at home just because he has to be mindful of his spending."}
{"text": "\u201cTell you what\u2026 how about you tell this Elsa sister of yours, to text me\u2026\u201d he drawls on as he scribbles his number on the paperwork (it was just one page that he typed up the night before to sell the lie that he\u2019s a professional) and slides it over to her."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd we can set up a meeting time when she\u2019s free.\u201d \n\nAnna sighs a sigh of relief and Jack guesses it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t have to walk out on their interview."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d then a wide smile forms on her lips."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd who knows, maybe the next time we see each other, I\u2019ll be your housemate\u2019s sister instead.\u201d She says casually to clear the tension\u2014or whatever this awkwardness was\u2014between them."}
{"text": "As they finish their goodbyes, Jack hopes the next time he sees the giddy woman, it\u2019ll be under different, less awkward, circumstances."}
{"text": "He realizes he doesn\u2019t even know her name."}
{"text": "~~\n\n\u201cYou told him what?"}
{"text": "!\u201d the woman looks at her sister from across their dinner table, justifiably perplexed and horrified."}
{"text": "Her last spoonful of pasta doesn\u2019t even make it into her mouth."}
{"text": "\u201cWell\u2026\u201d the younger woman reflexively leans back into her chair and she looks at her husband, Kristoff, for help, to which he pretends he doesn\u2019t see her."}
{"text": "She sighs, \u201cI told him that it would be better if you guys met\u2026 after all, Elsa\u2026 It\u2019s sort of your living situation.\u201d She gives a small laugh to take her point home, \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d Awkwardness and all."}
{"text": "Elsa sighs a defeated sigh, \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Logic and reason have always made sense to her."}
{"text": "\u201cGreat!\u201d Anna\u2019s smile finds its way back to her suspiciously soon."}
{"text": "\u201cFrom the ten minutes I\u2019ve met with him, I just know he\u2019s going to be a great housemate.\u201d \n\n\u201cTen minutes\u2026 alright\u2026,\u201d Elsa forces a smile and forces her terribly irrational self to trust her sister\u2019s words."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd here\u2019s his number,\u201d Anna slides the paper she had with her across the table, beckoning for Kristoff to help her pass it over to his sister-in-law."}
{"text": "\u201cOn the top right corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Elsa says as she eyes the paper up and down."}
{"text": "\u201cSo do I give him a call?"}
{"text": "Or text?\u201d\n\n\u201cEither\u2019s fine, I think, he seems chill enough for a text,\u201d Anna recalls her encounter with the white-haired man."}
{"text": "Then, her eyes light up, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s actually pretty cute\u2026\u201d She starts but gets interrupted by Kristoff choking on his pasta, followed by a puppy-dog look from him."}
{"text": "\u201cNot cuter than Kristoff though,\u201d She corrects herself between bites and giggles."}
{"text": "\u201cBut cute enough for you, Elsa.\u201d\n\nHer husband chokes on his food for the second time within five seconds."}
{"text": "Her sister gives her a look from across the table, and under the cozy, warm lamp overhead, she can see Elsa\u2019s eyes twinkle a bit."}
{"text": "Her smile opens in turn, \u201cYou know you\u2019re interested, sis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I though?"}
{"text": "\u201cElsa\u2019s expression turns into a skeptical one."}
{"text": "\u201cLast I checked\u2026 we have different types in men.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnna feigns offense but she still pushes for the supposed cute man she met, \u201cNo really, though."}
{"text": "Like he\u2019s genuinely your type Elsa\u2026 at least I think he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Elsa looks thoughtful (and doubtful), but in consideration of her little sister, she plays along."}
{"text": "\u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll let you know if I think he\u2019s cute."}
{"text": "Honestly.\u201d\n\nAnna groans at this, \u201cBut you never let me know when you think anyone is cute\u2014heck do you even think anyone is cute?\u2019\n\n\u201cI told you I have high standards, Anna.\u201d\n\n\nAnna gives her a devious look in return, \u201cWell, I think this guy will be the first.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think he\u2019s that cute, babe?\u201d Kristoff squeaks from his seat and laughter soon follows suit around the table."}
{"text": "~~\n\nIt\u2019s 10:05 at night when he receives a text from an unknown number."}
{"text": "He\u2019s brushing his teeth, scrolling through his recent collection of liked songs on Spotify (ninety percent rap, eight percent LoFi, and two percent EDM\u2014because his friend group partakes in raving sometimes)."}
{"text": "\u2018Hello.\u2019 It reads."}
{"text": "His eyebrows fold into itself and his face contorts into an unreadable expression as he just stares at the text."}
{"text": "Correct capitalization and punctuation."}
{"text": "Who the hell texts like this?"}
{"text": "\u2018I got your number from Anna, I\u2019m Elsa.\u2019 \n\nHis face soon relaxes as he leans down to spit out the toothpaste in his mouth."}
{"text": "Of course, it\u2019s this Elsa person."}
{"text": "He kind of feels sorry for doubting Anna about how prim and proper her sister was."}
{"text": "He leaves her waiting a bit and decides that rinsing his mouth, drying his face, and then going through his three-step nighttime skincare routine has higher priority than responding to the text."}
{"text": "It\u2019s 10:15 at night when he sends his response back to her."}
{"text": "hey elsa, this is jack."}
{"text": "the person you\u2019re trying to live with \n\nAnd although he doesn\u2019t really have the professionalism or the correct punctuation and capitalization like her, he at least, was proud of himself for spelling everything right."}
{"text": "Hello Jack."}
{"text": "I will only be interviewing in *hopes* of living with you."}
{"text": "Then,\nWhen would you like to arrange our meeting and where?"}
{"text": "Jack stares at the text a little, deciding what he should say."}
{"text": "Anna had warned him that her sister would be\u2014is\u2014a little professional but at her text, he\u2019s imagining all kinds of things that can go wrong with someone like him living with someone like her."}
{"text": "As his brain works overtime\u2014or works more than it even usually does\u2014he sends her a text back nonetheless: \n\nah yes, madamouiselle Elsa, I believe I am free to meet with you two days from now, would Sunday at around 5 pm work?"}
{"text": "At my house?"}
{"text": "He sees her typing a response\u2014the familiar three dots\u2014but two seconds later, it disappears and quickly comes another text."}
{"text": "Ah yes, Monsieur Jack, I will be free Sunday at around 5 PM."}
{"text": "Will there be tea and croissants?"}
{"text": "He smiles."}
{"text": "Maybe he can live with her."}
{"text": "there will be watever the brits or french have at tea time\nor watever\u2026 \n\nPerfect."}
{"text": "I will be looking forward to it."}
{"text": "See you then, o\u2019 great Lord Jackson of 2348 34th Street\n\nJack stares at his phone."}
{"text": "He\u2019s retired in bed now and his brain is working its ass off to come up with a witty\u2014worthy enough\u2014response."}
{"text": "He wants to say something that will continue their conversation, and give her more of a reason to want to talk to him over text."}
{"text": "He wants to know more about her."}
{"text": "But it\u2019s been well over ten minutes and a response any later than that would be rude."}
{"text": "So he just goes with the second-best option: \n\nperfect."}
{"text": "I\u2019ll see you then."}
{"text": ":) \n\nA smiley face."}
{"text": "A fucking smiley face."}
{"text": "Jackson Overland Frost doesn\u2019t do smiley faces."}
{"text": "But whatever, he thinks."}
{"text": "He knows he\u2019s overreacting over a five-minute text conversation, but he doesn\u2019t sleep that night."}
{"text": "~~\n\n\u201cSo what do you think of him?\u201d Anna asks her sister on Sunday morning, five minutes before Elsa\u2019s about to leave to go see him."}
{"text": "She skips her usual weird, skeptical look when she\u2019s asked something prematurely like this and gets straight to her response as she works her left arm into her oversized blue-knit cardigan, \u201cYou should ask me after I come back, Anna.\u201d She grabs her purse and keys from their counter and tucks her phone into her back jeans pocket."}
{"text": "Anna doesn\u2019t back down, \u201cI know you texted him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I did, you told me to,\u201d Elsa rolls her eyes at the obviousness of it all."}
{"text": "Why is Anna so persistent?"}
{"text": "\u201cI guess I did,\u201d Anna shrugs on the couch as she puts another Royce Chocolate\u2014something their cousin Rapunzel had brought back from her trip to Japan\u2014into her mouth."}
{"text": "\u201cBut still, did you enjoy your conversation with him?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was a five-minute conversation scheduling our meeting, Anna,\u201d Elsa\u2019s now fighting the urge to roll her eyes at her sisters\u2019 curiosity\u2014but honestly, she\u2019s a hair\u2019s length away from calling it nosiness."}
{"text": "But because she\u2019s a good older sister and she\u2019s a respectable adult and getting upset over this is far below her, she doesn\u2019t."}
{"text": "\u201cA lot can happen in a minute or two\u2014much less five,\u201d Anna says casually as she brings another piece of the yummy gooey goodness into her mouth."}
{"text": "\u201cLove at first sight is very real.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah but it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Elsa says as she opens the door."}
{"text": "Before closing it though, she squashes Anna\u2019s logic (or lack of) with one more remark, \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s very rare for that to occur, quite frankly, impossible even.\u201d\n\nAnna says nothing more about it but through the now closed door, Elsa hears a muffled, \u201cHave fun!\u201d\n\n~~\n\nJack gruntles in his much-too-tight knot again and his right index finger is deep in the tie\u2019s knot, wiggling around in it to get it right\u2014or at least get it to lose enough so that he doesn\u2019t die from suffocation, because how lame would that be?"}
{"text": "He mentally cursed his past self for being so worried about his meeting\u2014his interview\u2014with Elsa, that he forgot to tell Tooth about leaving the knot a little loose."}
{"text": "Or you can watch a YouTube video and learn how to tie it yourself."}
{"text": "He hears the scold in a familiar, annoying, Aussie accent."}
{"text": "He doesn\u2019t want to admit that he probably\u2014really\u2014should."}
{"text": "He grunts a little more in his bean bag chair and he\u2019s getting a little sweaty, so he goes to turn down the air in his apartment."}
{"text": "Ding."}
{"text": "And despite the air now being five degrees colder, he finds himself at least ten degrees warmer."}
{"text": "~~ \n\n\u201cHello!\u201d The door opens and out comes a man\u2014a very tall, relatively lean, relatively built man\u2014Elsa can tell, even under the light blue dress shirt he\u2019s wearing, she can just fucking tell."}
{"text": "His hair is even whiter than hers\u2014and his eyes are a bluer, deeper, icier pair."}
{"text": "She gulps."}
{"text": "And avoids staring at his thin lips and his (very sharp, very well-built, high cheekbones and all) jawline and his Adam\u2019s apple."}
{"text": "She avoids looking at the rest of his face altogether."}
{"text": "\u201cMadamoiselle Elsa, right?\u201d He smiles a cheeky smile and she sees how white, how straight, his teeth are."}
{"text": "She hates to admit it, she really really does, but Anna\u2019s right\u2014this man, Jack, is her type."}
{"text": "(And she didn\u2019t even know she had one.)"}
{"text": "She smiles and tries to be as professional as she can be given this newfound revelation."}
{"text": "She extends her hand out to him and plays along, \u201cOui, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you Monsier Jackson of 2348 34th Street.\u201d \n\nHe smiles again, along with a laugh this time."}
{"text": "It\u2019s a nice, cool kind of laugh\u2014genuine and sincere."}
{"text": "And it does things to her heart."}
{"text": "\u201cAh yes, please come in,\u201d he opens the door wider for her as he bows."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m afraid we ran out of the croissants, so tea and two-day-old cookies would have to do.\u201d Then, \u201cI\u2019ll go brew some right now for you if that\u2019s alright with you, Madame.\u201d He says this in a very bad, very lame, very faux combination of British and French accents and it takes all of Elsa\u2019s self-control and professionalism to not start laughing."}
{"text": "She\u2019s the first to break their act, \u201cNo no, it\u2019s alright, I\u2019m ready to start the interview.\u201d\n\nHe gives her a look, \u201cAre you sure, Elsa?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she nods."}
{"text": "\u201cAny more and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d be intruding.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, insisting, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019m technically the host.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d \n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive.\u201d\n\n~~\n\nJack finally surrenders and walks from the kitchen to the coffee table."}
{"text": "After a more formal introduction and a necessary handshake (for the sake of professionalism and for the sake that this is still a meeting, no matter how much he previously had wanted to laugh and joke around with her), he beckons her to her seat on the couch."}
{"text": "He\u2019s on the bean bag again, like all the other times and with all his other interviews, but this time he feels a little bit insecure."}
{"text": "And maybe even a little foolish."}
{"text": "He gulps a pathetic kind of gulp and tries to start the interview and the debrief but he has trouble making eye contact with her."}
{"text": "(Let it be known he has never, in his twenty-three years of life, had trouble making eye contact with anyone.)"}
{"text": "Growing up, he\u2019s always known he\u2019s been quite the looker\u2014thanks to his sister, he\u2019s even indulged himself in personal hygiene (not that he wouldn\u2019t without her), skincare (she forced the daily use of moisturizer and sunscreen onto him), and style (she couldn't stand the sight of his blue hoodie anymore)."}
{"text": "Dozens of women (and men) have developed crushes on him over the years\u2014he dated six of them for fuck\u2019s sake."}
{"text": "But here he is, bumbling his summarization of the interview and paperwork and expectations and everything like an idiot."}
{"text": "If he didn\u2019t fuck up his meeting with Anna last time\u2014who probably (definitely) told Elsa about it\u2014he\u2019d be labeled a bumbling fool after this performance."}
{"text": "\u201c...So yeah, that\u2019s pretty much the gist of it.\u201d\n\nGist?"}
{"text": "Gist of it?!"}
{"text": "He wants to royally facepalm himself."}
{"text": "\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Her bright blue eyes are staring at the paper in front of them for so hard, so long, that he\u2019s convinced she\u2019s burning a hole into it."}
{"text": "He wipes the sweat from his palms onto his trousers and hopes Grammarly has done its job and that she finds no typos."}
{"text": "He\u2019s also self-conscious that it\u2019s just one page\u2014one fucking sided too."}
{"text": "\u201cAny questions before we start the interview?\u201d\n\nShe shakes her head and he can\u2019t help but notice a loose strand from her braid, lazily done and lazily slumped over her shoulder."}
{"text": "It takes all of him to not look too long at her exposed collarbones."}
{"text": "\u201cJack?\u201d She calls out to him."}
{"text": "\u201cI don\u2019t have any questions, we can start now.\u201d\n\nHe looks back up at her and for some reason\u2014for some fucking terrible, weird, creepy, reason\u2014he decides he can\u2019t\u2014that he doesn\u2019t have it in him\u2014to continue this goddamn interview."}
{"text": "\u201cActually, we\u2014I\u2014can\u2019t\u2014\u201d he admits, furiously swiping the sweat from his palms now."}
{"text": "He even feels a bead trickling down his forehead."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m afraid this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\nShe looks at him, her eyebrows are knitted together and her lips twitch, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what you mean\u2014what do you mean this isn\u2019t going to work?\u201d She straightens her back even more (he didn\u2019t think it was possible)."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d He knows why this isn\u2019t going to work."}
{"text": "But he can\u2019t say it."}
{"text": "In what world, would \u2018Oh I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t live with you because I\u2019m a bumbling, stumbling, mess around you."}
{"text": "I can\u2019t hold a proper conversation with you without my palms getting super sweaty or my heart racing\u2014I can\u2019t even look at you without my eyes trailing to your collarbones or cleavage or something worse\u2014be an appropriate answer?"}
{"text": "He takes a deep breath and brings his head back to the dire situation he\u2019s faced with."}
{"text": "You literally just met her, for fucks\u2019 sake."}
{"text": "Nor are you a sixteen-year-old going through puberty and experiencing masturbation for the first time."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack,\u201d she says."}
{"text": "\u201cBut I would at least like to know what changed your mind about me\u2026\u201d she tries to get him to talk, and justifiably so."}
{"text": "So he opens his damn mouth and talks."}
{"text": "~~\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t live with someone I\u2019d like to ask out,\u201d he says in a hurried slur."}
{"text": "Elsa blinks."}
{"text": "She processes his onslaught of words and she blinks again."}
{"text": "Her mouth is slightly open and he\u2019s looking at her."}
{"text": "Oh."}
{"text": "Her lips had made the effort, and her mouth was now open, forming a very visible oh."}
{"text": "But her vocal cords refuse to cooperate with her intentions."}
{"text": "Oh."}
{"text": "A terribly awkward cough escapes him, before a, \u201cShit.\u201d\n\nShe hears him mumble under his breath."}
{"text": "And she sees him run a (sweaty?)"}
{"text": "hand through his tousled, messy, sexy white hair."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Elsa\u2014this\u2014\u201c he points between them."}
{"text": "She watches his finger as it points at her to him,  back to her, and finally back to him."}
{"text": "The odd nature of his confession and gesture finally makes its way to his head and he scrambles."}
{"text": "\u201cOh god, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014this is so fucking\u2014\u201c\n\nHe cuts himself in between his apology with a brief, \u201cHow could you Jack,\u201d which was meant to be unheard, directed towards himself."}
{"text": "She heard it anyway."}
{"text": "And it takes all of the muscles in her lips to refrain from curving upwards."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is so unprofessional of me, I just\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201c\n\nElsa\u2019s voice finally decides to work, but it says something she hadn\u2019t meant to\u2014at least not so fast or so soon\u2014or at all."}
{"text": "It speaks without her thinking first."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s alright because I feel the same.\u201d\n\n~~\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know whether or not he\u2019s donning a look of pure surprise or confusion, or both, or worse: utter horror."}
{"text": "The gorgeous woman on his sofa refused to speak further, but the new foreign look in her eyes betrayed her; he was so sure they looked like his\u2014horrified and overwhelmed by the terrible mistake of her words."}
{"text": "To a much lesser extent though, give or take."}
{"text": "He licks his suddenly dry lips before continuing, \u201cAlright then\u2026\u201d\n\nHe tries his best at professionalism\u2014something he doesn\u2019t do well with."}
{"text": "\u201cSince we both have said some\u2014rather unfortunate\u2026\u201d\n\nThe silence between his gaps is sucking the soul out of him."}
{"text": "\u201cSince we both have admitted to something we shouldn't have,\u201d she admits (which causes his eyes to round like dinner plates) and finishes his trailing sentence for him."}
{"text": "He bites his tongue to keep himself sane, \u201cRight, thank you, Elsa.\u201d\n\nShe nods."}
{"text": "\u2026\n\nHis head is still running miles\u2014working overtime\u2014to try and keep up with the situation\u2014and the rapid development of it."}
{"text": "Although rare, if ever, it\u2019s times and situations like these where he\u2019s convinced himself he\u2019s going to fucking murder \u2018that damn motherfucker\u2019 Hiccup."}
{"text": "He hears her sigh from across the coffee table."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, s-since we both agreed on how our living arrangement\u2026\u201d She does the thing that he did just minutes before, the pointing between them."}
{"text": "\u201cIsn\u2019t going to work\u2026 I better be going now.\u201d\n\nShe brings her left arm to her face, and his eyes follow her movement."}
{"text": "It happened quickly but Jack had seen it."}
{"text": "Under her oversized, mushroom-like sleeve of a cardigan, he realizes she isn\u2019t wearing a watch."}
{"text": "Well isn\u2019t this just awkward for the both of them."}
{"text": "You should have just shut your damn mouth, Jackson."}
{"text": "\u201cJack?\u201d Her crystal clear voice calls out to him again."}
{"text": "\u201cAh\u2014right,\u201d he forces a laugh out of himself to try and convince her that\u2014although he\u2019s a bumbling idiot\u2014he\u2019s not a total, complete, unaware fool."}
{"text": "He may well be on his way there though."}
{"text": "\u201cI promise I\u2019m not like this normally\u2014running my mouth when I don't mean it.\u201d\n\nHe could\u2019ve said his goodbyes and he could\u2019ve led her to the door, wave her off, never see her again and pretend none of this ever happened, but instead, he tries to save it."}
{"text": "Whatever it is."}
{"text": "\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d Her face drops and she looks at him quizzically."}
{"text": "He actually facepalms himself now."}
{"text": "\u201cN-No I meant\u2014I meant I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to say it because you didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean to say it out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t mean to say it out loud because you didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d\n\nThis woman is going to be the death of him."}
{"text": "In the worst, and possibly the best, way possible."}
{"text": "\u201cNo Elsa, I\u2014\u201c he sighs because he didn\u2019t think there would be more weird creepy confessions this afternoon, but alas, he had to jinx it, because another one\u2019s about to come out of his damn mouth."}
{"text": "\u201cI think you\u2019re gorgeous\u2014so gorgeous and beautiful, and I can tell it\u2019s not only your looks that are beautiful, so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m shallow.\u201d\n\nHe pauses to catch his breath but also to take her face in."}
{"text": "She\u2019s looking at him, with her mouth forming that familiar \u2018oh\u2019 shape he\u2019s pretty much used to by now, her bright blue eyes are shining brighter than he\u2019s ever seen it\u2014maybe because of the bits of sunlight filtering through his curtains."}
{"text": "Her braid is also catching the light and it\u2019s practically glowing."}
{"text": "He continues when he catches his eyes trailing to her collarbone."}
{"text": "\u201cSo I had meant it\u2014and I still do think so."}
{"text": "But I didn\u2019t mean to say it out loud\u2026 especially not to you.\u201d\n\nIt takes her a good five seconds to respond to him and he winces on the fourth."}
{"text": "~~\n\n\u201cI-I see,\u201d she finally says."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m very flattered, Jack.\u201d\n\n He nods a rather measly\u2014defeated(?"}
{"text": ")\u2014sort of nod."}
{"text": "She didn\u2019t know what to say or do anymore after she thanked him."}
{"text": "Elsa knows she shouldn\u2019t be impulsive and every last bit of logic and reasoning is screaming at her not to, but she does it anyway."}
{"text": "She tells him her truth."}
{"text": "And tells herself that it\u2019s only fair because she has heard his."}
{"text": "\u201cThank you for your honesty.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t look at her and just nods."}
{"text": "\u201cI also\u2014\u201cShe looks at his hands and begins to grow hot because she sees how well-defined and firm and long his fingers are."}
{"text": "She also gulps at the snowflake tattoo on the side of his wrist."}
{"text": "(It\u2019s a combination of the rolled up sleeve of his light blue dress shirt and the tattoo that\u2019s making her feel this way)."}
{"text": "\u201cI also feel the same way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout not wanting to live with me?\u201d There\u2019s a sort of hopeful glint in his eye."}
{"text": "But it\u2019s quickly replaced with even more dread and horror."}
{"text": "\u201cYes,\u201d she stalls and it leads him to conclusions."}
{"text": "\u201cBecause I\u2019m a flirt and creepy and weird, right?"}
{"text": "Because I\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she interrupts him; she\u2019s not the type to interrupt anyone."}
{"text": "\u201cNot because of that, it\u2019s because I\u2014\u201c\n\nHe patiently waits for her to continue."}
{"text": "She feels her bum sweat and her jeans get a little moist."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s because I also think you\u2019re attractive, and I would also like to make it clear that I\u2019m not a shallow person\u2014in fact, I\u2019m\u2014my sister, Anna, says I\u2019m a picky person.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s his turn to turn to leave her hanging."}
{"text": "\u201cSo please don\u2019t think I\u2019m some weird flirt or creepy woman trying to live with someone she wants to fu\u2014\u201c\n\nShe stops herself."}
{"text": "And coughs."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, I agree with you."}
{"text": "About how this arrangement isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\nReally, this is so unbecoming of her."}
{"text": "She swears she sees his mouth tug on an upward curve at her (fatal) mistake."}
{"text": "~~\n\nThe next few moments come as a blur to him; it\u2019s a combination of the unrealness of it all and the cold temperature in the room, something he doesn\u2019t mind."}
{"text": "\u201cT\u2013That\u2019s great,\u201d he rubs his hands against his gray cotton sweatpants."}
{"text": "\u201cWould you\u2014would you like to give this\u2014\u201d he does the finger thing again, pointing back and forth between them."}
{"text": "\u201cWould you like to give us a try and go on a\u2014\u201d he gulps."}
{"text": "No woman\u2014anyone\u2014has ever made him this nervous before."}
{"text": "And he\u2019s met his fair share of pretty women and had his fair share of spontaneous, fun, nights."}
{"text": "\u201cDate,\u201d he coughs up the dreadful word; and even though he doesn\u2019t even know what he wants their relationship to be, he knows the word doesn\u2019t do it justice."}
{"text": "She blinks and he swears he\u2019s seeing stars."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say no, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s okay\u2014\u201d He stops his mouth as his brain finally catches up."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, I would love to go on a date with you,\u201d she says it, the phrase in all of its entirety and clarity; and there\u2019s no room for any more embarrassing misunderstandings."}
{"text": "He allows the muscles around his lips to work properly this time and his mouth opens into a splendid\u2014Jack-like (let it be known that he hasn\u2019t been acting like himself this entire afternoon)\u2014grin."}
{"text": "~~\n\nEverything about his smile\u2014its lopsidedness, the white of his teeth against his pale, thin lips, and the genuineness of it\u2014does scary things to her heart."}
{"text": "She feels the rapid, growing thump and there\u2019s nothing she can do about it but hope that the air conditioner is louder than her beating heart."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2014\u201d he\u2019s still smiling, a grin so wide it becomes contagious and she finds her lips mirroring the utter happiness and joy in his."}
{"text": "\u201cGod, this situation,\u201d he does the pointing thing again."}
{"text": "\u201cTurned out better than I can ever hope for.\u201d\n\nNow, with two smiling idiots in the room, she sheds away any lingering pride and self-consciousness and speaks up again, this time in an awful British accent."}

{"text": "It\u2019s well into the afternoon now and the sun shines more light into the room, through the balcony door, and through the thin white curtains."}

{"text": "\u201cHe looks at her, a little taken aback and surprised, before looking down at his attire."}
{"text": "~~ \n\nHe\u2019s wearing a light blue dress shirt\u2014it\u2019s a little crinkly because he pulled it from his closet in a last-ditch effort to seem professional enough for what he initially thought Elsa to be."}
{"text": "He didn\u2019t bother to do the top-most button."}
{"text": "Grey, baggy sweatpants wrap around his legs and he\u2019s in his bright blue house slippers."}
{"text": "He runs his hand through his hair."}
{"text": "Yup, a tangled, ungelled mess."}
{"text": "\u201cRight now,\u201d she nods."}
{"text": "\u201cLike\u2026 right now right now?\u201d\n\nHe watches her as she stands up from his sofa\u2014and he fights back the urge to watch his couch recover from the indent her ass had made."}

{"text": "She shakes her head, \u201cYou look fine\u2014in fact\u2014\u201d She eyes him up and down and he grows the urge to cover himself."}
{"text": "\u201cYou look good.\u201d \n\nHe gets up from his bean bag chair and takes her hand instead."}
{"text": "Instinctively\u2014naturally maybe\u2014his fingers make their way between hers and he\u2019s holding her small hand in his."}

{"text": "She doesn\u2019t let go."}
{"text": "\u201cWhere to?\u201d He\u2019s smiling again, as he\u2019s looking down at her; now that he\u2019s standing up, he\u2019s a whole head taller than her."}

{"text": "Before he knows it, they\u2019re both at the door now and she\u2019s slipping her feet into sandals."}
{"text": "He does nothing but just look at her."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you trust me, Jack?"}
{"text": "Will you follow me?\u201d She finally says, her bright sky-blue eyes boring into his."}
{"text": "\u201cAnywhere.\u201d\n\n~~\n\nAnna\u2019s eating dinner with her dear fiance, Kristoff, when she sees it."}
{"text": "Her phone chimes a familiar ping and she glances a few inches to the left of her rice bowl."}

{"text": "Jack lets out his worst groan of the night yet and decides to kick the bigger-than-a-pebble rock in front of him and proceeds to yelp in pain and lets out a mandatory, accompanying expletive just because he\u2019s the type to curse at any inconvenience\u2014but mainly\u2014just because he can."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat the absolute fuck is wrong with you, mate,\u201d Bunny asks as he looks back over his shoulder and gives Jack a look of pure, genuine disgust."}
{"text": "(Or as genuine as disgust goes for best friends.)"}
{"text": "For reasons unbeknownst to Jack, Bunny also puts his arms around Tooth\u2019s\u2014his girlfriend's\u2014shoulder and brings her closer to himself, and away from Jack."}
{"text": "Soon, as all interactions between them go, Jack and Bunny spiral into a harmless(?)"}
{"text": "squabble on the busy, crowded streets of Times Square, and every other word between them is either a curse word or an insult\u2014or both."}
{"text": "\u201cGuys,\u201d Tooth\u2019s rolling her eyes and intervening (like she usually does)."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas for fuck\u2019s sake, stop embarrassing us.\u201d\n\nSandy nods and Jamie chimes in, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jack?"}
{"text": "You\u2019re usually not this grouchy, especially not on your favorite holiday, like\u2026 ever.\u201d\n\nJack sighs again."}

{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s the superintendent, Pitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHim again?\u201d Bunny asks as the group makes their way through the growing crowd in Times Square."}

{"text": "Not tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Jack parrots him."}
{"text": "\u201cNot tonight."}
{"text": "Sorry guys.\u201d He apologizes as he tries to keep up with them."}
{"text": "It\u2019s getting hard to do as the crowd grows denser though."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026 we\u2019re here!\u201d Tooth exclaims excitedly as she takes in the sight in front of her."}
{"text": "The group is standing in front of a huge outdoor ice rink."}
{"text": "There\u2019s a giant (like really big) Christmas tree in the center of it all and everywhere Jack looks, people are smiling and chatting and enjoying themselves."}
{"text": "It really is Christmas, after all."}
{"text": "He kind of feels silly for letting his boss\u2019s antics get to him."}
{"text": "\u201cLet\u2019s take a photo first!\u201d Tooth points to the photo booth a few feet away from the ticket stand as she drags Bunny along and gestures for the group to follow."}
{"text": "\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d Jack notices it first."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He leans into the photo dispenser box and picks it up, inspecting it."}
{"text": "Jamie brings his face in and stares at it."}
{"text": "\u201cSomeone must\u2019ve forgotten to grab their photos.\u201d \n\n\u201cTwo people, you mean,\u201d Jack corrects him as he looks closer at the pictures."}
{"text": "He knows he shouldn\u2019t and he knows this is probably a fucking invasion of privacy and that there are better ways to go about things than fucking staring down and practically burning a hole through the strip of photos."}
{"text": "The blonde girl\u2019s pretty though, he thinks to himself."}
{"text": "\u201cStop staring at her, bro,\u201d Jamie gives him a look."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re practically drooling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s drooling?\u201d Bunny peaks his nosy head between them as he and Tooth finally reach them."}
{"text": "Sandy points to Jack."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s he lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Bunny asks, all the more curious as a sinister grin appears on his (annoying) face."}
{"text": "Jack prays to god Tooth stops him, but like her boyfriend, she lets the curiosity get the better of her."}
{"text": "\u201cShe\u2019s pretty,\u201d she says his damn thoughts out loud."}
{"text": "She must be a mind reader, he thinks."}
{"text": "\u201cI can understand why you\u2019re staring so hard, Jack.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d Jamie\u2019s holding back his laughter."}
{"text": "\u201cIs the overworked schoolteacher finally interested in someone?\u201d \n\nHe puts it away and stuffs the strip into his coat pocket."}
{"text": "\u201cStop it guys, you know I haven\u2019t dated\u2014much less been interested in anyone\u2014since high school.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Jamie sighs."}
{"text": "\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just take the photos.\u201d\n\n~\n\n\u201cElsa?\u201d Anna stops in her tracks as she looks back at her sister who also stopped, but just a few feet behind her."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She lets out a small shiver and rubs her gloved hands together to warm herself."}
{"text": "\u201cWe forgot to get the photos from the photobooth\u2026\u201d Elsa sighs and instinctively looks back to where they had just come from."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can,\u201d she sighs dejectedly as she wraps her scarf around her tighter."}
{"text": "The crowd\u2019s gotten bigger and just getting back to the ice rink at the center of it all would be a challenge in itself."}
{"text": "\u201cAw, that sucks,\u201d Anna looks behind them as well."}
{"text": "\u201cBut oh well, I guess it\u2019s too late now."}
{"text": "We can always take another.\u201d\n\nElsa smiles at her sister\u2019s optimism."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, yeah I suppose we always can.\u201d\n\n~\n\nJack\u2019s laughing his ass off as he watches from inside the McDonald\u2019s as Bunny\u2019s getting his ass handed to him by Tooth on the streets."}
{"text": "They were wrapping up their skating session and Bunny had thought it would be funny to sneak up on Jack and push him."}
{"text": "Long story short, Jack survived the fall\u2014for the most part, give or take one or two bruises that will inevitably form on his knees tomorrow."}
{"text": "To be honest, he doesn\u2019t really mind, because someone once told him that bruises are a reminder that you\u2019re alive, because don\u2019t form on corpses."}
{"text": "Or something."}
{"text": "But he will never tell Bunny\u2014or Tooth\u2014that fact, because if he did, then he wouldn\u2019t be enjoying his front-row seats to the shit show just beyond the see-through McDonald\u2019s wall."}
{"text": "This is an all-time low for Bunny that Jack swears he will never not remind him of."}
{"text": "He\u2019s laughing but because he\u2019s enjoying the scene a little too much, too hard, he doesn\u2019t notice Sandy getting up from his seat before it\u2019s too late."}
{"text": "\u201cAw, man I should\u2019ve stopped him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really enjoying this, aren\u2019t you, Jack?\u201d Jamie looks over at him, amused."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah,\u201d he snickers."}
{"text": "\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nJamie laughs as Jack looks elsewhere."}
{"text": "That\u2019s when he sees her."}
{"text": "It\u2019s a damn motherfucking Christmas miracle."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nJamie still isn\u2019t rid of his laughter."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nJack\u2019s working furiously to button up his coat and he picks up his keys and phone from the booth he was just sitting at."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, tell the rest of the gang I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack?\u201d Jamie\u2019s confused."}
{"text": "But before he can ask Jack what\u2019s really happening, he\u2019s already out the door."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you hear that, Anna?\u201d Elsa stops in her tracks."}
{"text": "\u201cSomeone\u2019s shouting something.\u201d \n\n\u201cCrazy people, am I right?\u201d Anna laughs it off as she tugs at Elsa\u2019s hand."}
{"text": "\u201cCome on, we\u2019re going to miss the crosslight.\u201d \n\n~\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jack\u2019s trying and trying his best to get their attention amongst the crowd."}
{"text": "He\u2019s aware, of how crazy this is and how crazy he must look."}
{"text": "The worst part is, he doesn\u2019t even know their names to make it any less harder for him."}
{"text": "\u201cThe blonde and strawberry blonde girls!\u201d\n\nThis is the fucking worst, he thinks to himself."}
{"text": "Because really, how fucking crazy does he seem right now?"}
{"text": "He\u2019s already getting looks and side-eyes."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cI think that man is talking about us, Anna,\u201d Elsa still doesn\u2019t budge from her place on the sidewalk."}
{"text": "Anna\u2019s already halfway across the street, \u201cCome on Elsa!\u201d She shouts back."}
{"text": "\u201cBefore it\u2019s too late!\u201d\n\n\u201cCross without me!\u201d Elsa\u2019s waving and shouting back now."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side!\u201d \n\nAnna looks hesitant but at her sister\u2019s wave and smile, she obliges."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jack finally catches up to the girl."}
{"text": "\u201cI know I must seem like a fucking lunatic right now, but thanks for waiting.\u201d His heart\u2019s beating and he tells himself it\u2019s because of his lack of breath but his mind knows it\u2019s also because of the (awfully pretty, gorgeous, beautiful) girl in front of him."}
{"text": "There\u2019s one thought in his mind right now: the photobooth picture did not do her justice."}
{"text": "He swallows his saliva to calm his beating heart."}
{"text": "She laughs."}
{"text": "He\u2019s going to lose it."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s good to be self-aware at least."}
{"text": "It tells me you\u2019re not a creepy guy.\u201d\n\nEven her fucking voice is pretty."}
{"text": "\u201cHere, I found your photos at the photo booth a little while ago\u201d he explains himself first before he awkwardly reaches into his pockets and searches for the strip."}
{"text": "(Because\u2014even though he may be an idiot\u2014even he knows how creepy it would be if he reached into his pockets before saying even a single word to the pretty lady in front of him."}
{"text": "If he did that, then he\u2019d actually freak her out)."}
{"text": "He hands it to her."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry, it\u2019s a bit wrinkly though\u2014because really\u2014what are the chances I\u2019d actually find you tonight?\u201d\n\nHer eyes light up, \u201cOh my gosh, thank you so much, you have no idea how much I regretted forgetting to pick it up.\u201d\n\n\n~\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nThe tall (cute) guy in front of her grins and tilts his head to the side a little."}
{"text": "This does scary things to her heart."}
{"text": "The cross signal comes back up again but she still doesn\u2019t move from her place on the street."}
{"text": "People are passing them and she\u2019s very aware of the situation they\u2019re both in, but she isn\u2019t quite ready to let this stranger go yet."}
{"text": "\u201cReally, thank you so much, do you mind if my sister\u2014the other woman in this photo\u2014and I treat you to some coffee or something?\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s eyes light up at her offer, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me?\u201d He jokes."}
{"text": "\u201cNope, not at least until after you\u2019re fed,\u201d she smirks."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that offer, Miss\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cElsa.\u201d It\u2019s not like her, she thinks."}
{"text": "To offer a man her name in the first five minutes of meeting him\u2014much less two."}
{"text": "\u201cJust call me Elsa.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Elsa.\u201d He gives her one of those damn grins again."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Jack.\u201d\n\n~\n\n\u201cElsa!\u201d The strawberry blonde\u2014her sister, if his memory serves him right\u2014runs up to the pair."}
{"text": "She\u2019s a little out of breath and every time she breathes, Jack sees clouds escape her mouth."}
{"text": "\u201cI was waiting for you but you never came."}
{"text": "So I ran back here instead.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh\u2014\u201d Elsa realizes her mistake."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Anna, I was caught up with someone.\u201d She gestures to Jack."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is Jack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Anna,\u201d Anna whistles and gives Elsa a look."}
{"text": "A look Jack notices but Elsa ignores."}
{"text": "\u201cHe\u2019s the gentleman who was calling to us earlier\u2014so he can return this,\u201d she shows Anna the strip of photos."}
{"text": "Anna\u2019s face lights up as she laughs, \u201cGood to know he\u2019s not some creepy stalker dude.\u201d\n\nJack feigns offense, \u201cI tried my best, okay?"}
{"text": "It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re working without names.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyways, as I was saying, I told him we\u2019d invite him for coffee,\u201d Elsa brings back her offer from earlier."}
{"text": "\u201cSure,\u201d Anna smiles."}
{"text": "Jack notices a weird hint of something in her eyes but because he doesn\u2019t know her well enough, he doesn\u2019t assume and doesn\u2019t question her intentions."}
{"text": "\u201cHow about tonight?\u201d\n\nElsa blinks."}
{"text": "\u201cTonight?\u201d The both of them say in unison."}
{"text": "Anna bursts out laughing again."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m down for tonight, are you guys?"}
{"text": "I\u2019ll ask Kristoff to come as well, do you two mind?\u201d\n\nElsa looks hesitant, \u201cI don\u2019t really have any more plans tonight, but I\u2019m unsure about Jack\u2026\u201d\n\nHe really, really really really wants to say yes, because really, how often is it that an extremely pretty girl asks you out for coffee?"}
{"text": "(Well, he guesses it was more of Anna that made it happen tonight, but Elsa was the one who offered)."}
{"text": "But he also isn\u2019t the type to flake on his friends\u2026 \n\n\u201cThere he is, Jack!\u201d a familiar voice calls out to him."}
{"text": "Speak of the devils."}
{"text": "\u201cJack!\u201d Tooth calls out to him this time."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy did you run off on us without saying anything?\u201d\n\n~\n\nElsa looks from Jack to the woman who came up to him."}
{"text": "She\u2019s a whole foot shorter than him but she can tell Jack looks up to this person\u2014she sees it in the way he brings his hands to the nape of his neck, softens his voice, and apologizes to her."}
{"text": "She doesn\u2019t notice the rest of the group until another one of them says something."}
{"text": "\u201cSo that\u2019s the situation, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Anna breaks the silence between the two groups."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Anna, and this is my sister Elsa."}
{"text": "I take it you guys are Jack\u2019s friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup!\u201d a brunette boy extends his hand out to Anna."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Jamie, this is Sandy, Aster, and Tiana."}
{"text": "You two are the ones in the photos right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup!\u201d Anna pops her p. Elsa knows she\u2019s excited about meeting new people."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you guys, thank you so much for taking care of our photos and returning it.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Elsa feels a little differently about meeting new people though."}
{"text": "It\u2019s not because she\u2019s scared or anything, but because she\u2019s more or less been an introvert her entire life."}
{"text": "And honestly, this is just too much stimulation and faces and names, too much too soon."}
{"text": "\u201cDid Jack scare you guys?\u201d the woman in the group, Tiana, asks."}
{"text": "\u201cWho are ye kidding, this is Jack, of course, he scared them,\u201d Aster says in his heavy Australian accent."}
{"text": "Anna laughs again, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it, but imagine an unknown man pushing and running through a crowd shouting \u2018hey!\u2019 at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he did that,\u201d Jamie gives him a look of \u2018are you an idiot\u2019 and Sandy laughs."}
{"text": "\u201cI told you I tried my best with the information I had,\u201d Jack whines."}
{"text": "\u201cThis is what I get for helping strangers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, since everyone\u2019s here\u2026\u201d Elsa doesn\u2019t know where this confidence is coming from."}
{"text": "\u201cAs thanks, why don\u2019t my sister and I treat you guys to drinks or something?\u201d \n\n~ \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice lads, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Bunny says after the sisters left with a man named Kristoff, who they had learned, was Anna\u2019s fiance of two months."}
{"text": "(They were also invited to their wedding in March)."}
{"text": "Jack huffs out a cloud and buries his face further into his scarf."}
{"text": "It\u2019s almost midnight now and the both of them are standing outside a Starbucks, waiting for the rest of their group to finish using the restroom or washing their hands or asking for the cute barista\u2019s number or whatever."}
{"text": "It\u2019s getting a bit chilly but Jack doesn\u2019t mind."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah,\u201d he hums in agreement as the night\u2019s events are catching up to him."}
{"text": "Right now, he wants nothing more than to take a nice, cold, shower, climb in his bed, and nap for the rest of winter break."}
{"text": "\u201cThey\u2019re quite a bunch, alright.\u201d\n\nBunny laughs before he slaps Jack in the face with his words, \u201cYou like her\u2014Elsa\u2014don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Jack guffaws and whiplashes his face towards Bunny\u2019s."}

{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd, I\u2019m not some horny teenager.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really pretty though, I would go for it if I were you.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to yourself man,\u201d Jack rolls his eyes and teases Bunny because he doesn\u2019t want his (lack of a) love life to be the topic of conversation."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat would Tooth say?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur relationship is mature enough that me giving one of my best lads my honest opinion on a girl wouldn\u2019t ruin it,\u201d Bunny smirks, like the damn professional mature know-it-all tech-bro he is."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m just giving you a little push of encouragement, Jack."}
{"text": "That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nJack sighs out another cloud of air."}
{"text": "\u201cI wasn\u2019t even brave enough to ask her for her number.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can always ask Tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk me what?\u201d Tooth pokes her head between both of her friends as Jamie and Sandy follow right behind her."}
{"text": "She beckons to Bunny."}
{"text": "\u201cJack has something he wants to ask you,\u201d Bunny answers for the both of them as he hands Tooth his cup of matcha which she happily takes as she gives him a quick kiss on the cheek."}
{"text": "Even though Jack has been around them since high school\u2014since they started dating\u2014he groans, \u201cCan you guys not do that in front of us single people?"}
{"text": "It\u2019s honestly kind of depressing.\u201d \n\nThe both of them laugh, \u201cJust find someone, Jack.\u201d Bunny raises his eyebrows and gives him a knowing look."}
{"text": "The group is walking to their apartment now\u2014Jack, Sandy, and Jamie are roommates, and Bunny and Tooth live just two floors above them."}
{"text": "(Jack\u2019s surprised they\u2019re all still this close and their friend group is still functioning despite more or less living together for years now."}
{"text": "However, with a psychiatrist in the group, problems were resolved rather quickly)."}
{"text": "\u201cSo what did you want to ask Tooth?\u201d Jamie asks during their walk."}
{"text": "Bunny shoots him a look."}
{"text": "Jack knows that if he doesn\u2019t ask Tooth about it, then Bunny will ask for him."}
{"text": "That\u2019s the last thing he wants."}
{"text": "\u201cOh, uhm\u2026\u201d He\u2019s so fucking embarrassed right now, but one more look at Bunny and he caves."}
{"text": "\u201cI was wondering if you can give me Elsa\u2019s number.\u201d\n\nTooth lets out an \u2018oh\u2019 sound and Bunny\u2019s chuckles while looking at him and Jamie\u2019s fucking laughing his ass off and Sandy\u2019s trying his best to calm Jamie down, but Jack can tell it\u2019s taking the psychiatrist his entire fucking willpower to stop himself from laughing as well."}
{"text": "He sees it in the small quirk of his lips and the clench in his hands."}
{"text": "\u201cCome on guys,\u201d he gives his best friends a look."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m trying my best, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Jackson \u2018Frost\u2019 Overland being single for the rest of his life?\u201d Jamie asks between laughter."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s if she even likes me that away,\u201d Jack corrects him as he rolls his eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cSo about her number, Tooth\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she brings out her phone."}
{"text": "\u201cHere.\u201d She shows him Elsa\u2019s contact page."}
{"text": "He notices the accompanying name first."}
{"text": "He squints."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy the hell is her saved name, Elsa, Jack\u2019s gee-eff.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh my fucking god, no way you didn\u2019t, babe.\u201d Bunny\u2019s laughing his ass off now, Sandy finally loses his composure, and Jamie\u2019s laughing as hard as ever."}
{"text": "The group\u2019s getting looks from everyone who walks by them now, but none of them seem to care."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s so fucking creepy, Tooth, what would she think if she sees that?"}
{"text": "!\u201d Jack\u2019s fighting the embarrassment."}
{"text": "Tooth shrugs and smiles, \u201cYou never know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuys!\u201d Jack complains and groans and whines, and even though it\u2019s past midnight in the middle of winter on Christmas Eve (Christmas Day now, really), he feels his entire face (and ears) burning up."}
{"text": "\u201cCome on, is my misery really that funny?\u201d\n\n~\n\nIt\u2019s 12:54 AM."}
{"text": "That\u2019s when Elsa gets a text from a number she doesn\u2019t recognize."}
{"text": "She\u2019s just finished drying her hair when she sees it."}
{"text": "Unknown: hey."}
{"text": "A few seconds later, another text follows."}
{"text": "This is Jack."}
{"text": "She giggles to herself as she types her response."}
{"text": "You know you have a habit of making your first impressions borderline creepy."}
{"text": "Then, hey Jack."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cElsaaa!\u201d Anna knocks on her sister\u2019s door."}
{"text": "\u201cWake up, it\u2019s Christmas, it\u2019s Christmas!\u201d \n\nAnna doesn\u2019t give Elsa time to get up from her bed to open the door\u2014or even to open her eyes awake\u2014before she opens the door and steps in."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s fucking Christmas, Elsa!\u201d Anna says in her singsong voice, a clear sign she\u2019s excited."}
{"text": "\u201cAny plans for today?\u201d\n\nElsa groans as she brings the blanket up over her face when Anna presses the button against the wall, bringing up the blinds."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Anna tells her."}
{"text": "This wakes Elsa up."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat?!"}
{"text": "That has to be a mistake, right?"}
{"text": "No way it\u2019s past noon.\u201d\n\nAnna sighs, \u201cBelieve it or not sis, it\u2019s two alright."}
{"text": "It\u2019s not like you to stay in bed for so long, what were you doing last night?\u201d\n\nElsa blushes a little but unfortunately, her little sister has always had a sixth sense for things like this."}
{"text": "\u201cOr rather, who were you doing last night?\u201d\n\nElsa gives her sister a look, \u201cCome on, Anna."}
{"text": "It\u2019s not like that, I was just\u2014\u201d She considers keeping it from Anna."}
{"text": "\u201cYou were texting Jack, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Elsa sucks at acting and pretending and lying, especially to her younger sister, but she still tries anyway."}
{"text": "Because there is no way Anna\u2019s first fucking guess is right on the mark."}
{"text": "There\u2019s just no way, Elsa thinks to herself as she continues to deny it, \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you were texting, Jack.\u201d Anna smiles a smug smile."}
{"text": "\u201cI know you well, really well."}
{"text": "I grew up with you, Elsa.\u201d She then giggles like she\u2019s back in high school."}
{"text": "She\u2019s already imagining the entirety of Elsa\u2019s future with Jack."}
{"text": "\u201cI was just getting to know him better,\u201d Elsa makes an excuse for herself."}
{"text": "\u201cConsidering we invited his whole friend group to your wedding\u2014may I remind you we\u2019ve known them for less than twenty-four hours?\u201d\nAnna gives her sister a quizzical, doubtful look, \u201cThey\u2019re a nice bunch so sure you were, Elsa."}
{"text": "I totally believe you when you say you\u2019re scouting the strangers or whatever.\u201d \n\nElsa sighs and gets out of bed."}
{"text": "She slips her feet into her slippers and admits defeat, she never got away with lying to Anna about her love life to begin with, so why try now?"}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, I was texting Jack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re attracted to him, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Anna pursues."}
{"text": "\u201cBecause goddamn is that man good-looking."}
{"text": "He\u2019s like\u2026 the only person in the world who looks well with hair as white as his.\u201d\n\nElsa sighs, \u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\u201cElsa.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, yeah,\u201d she sighs."}
{"text": "\u201cI guess he\u2019s a little bit my type.\u201d\n\nAnna laughs, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you have a type.\u201d\n\n~ \n\n\u201cWhat are you bringing to the party, tonight?\u201d Jamie asks Jack as he zips up his coat."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd can I put my name on it?\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s lounging on their couch, watching TV because he has nothing better to do on Christmas Day\u2014at least not until tonight anyway."}
{"text": "\u201cNachos and chips,\u201d he responds but doesn\u2019t look away from his phone."}
{"text": "\u201cProbably, I don\u2019t know, something cheap though.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool.\u201d Jack hears the jingling of keys against phone."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll split it with you then.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jack hums."}
{"text": "\u201cNot gonna wish me luck for my date?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going on a date?\u201d Jack\u2019s eyes finally leave his phone and he\u2019s looking at Jamie, eyes so wide and blue they look like they\u2019re going to pop out out of his sockets."}
{"text": "\u201cIf you were half-listening last night, you would\u2019ve known, I told Sandy this bro.\u201d\n\n\nJack pouts, \u201cHey, I was just tired, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie denies this and calls him out for his bullshit."}
{"text": "\u201cYou think I\u2019m an idiot, don\u2019t you Jack?"}
{"text": "You were texting Elsa, everyone and their mothers know this.\u201d\nJack gasps, \u201cYou know me too well, Jams.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got no plans today, right?"}
{"text": "Just ask her out and invite her to the party tonight or something,\u201d Jamie suggests."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do with my date today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Jack looks back at his phone."}
{"text": "\u201cGood luck on your date.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jamie smiles."}
{"text": "\u201cI better see Elsa tonight though, and maybe Anna and Kristoff.\u201d\n\n~\n\nDing."}
{"text": "Elsa was never the type to jump at any notifications."}
{"text": "She knows how detrimental the chime is to the human brain, but she can\u2019t\u2014and doesn\u2019t\u2014help it this time."}
{"text": "She looks looks at her phone."}
{"text": "Anna notices this development with her sister and looks over at Elsa from her place on the couch."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat\u2019d Jack say?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I not.\u201d Anna rolls her eyes as if it\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world."}
{"text": "\u201cYou barely text."}
{"text": "Let alone, barely addicted to your phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s inviting me out for dinner this afternoon\u2026\u201d Elsa starts."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd the three of us to a party tonight.\u201d\n\n\nAnna\u2019s eyes widen in excitement."}
{"text": "\u201cNo way a party?\u201d Then her face falls."}
{"text": "\u201cUnfortunately, Kristoff and I have plans tonight, but you should definitely go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d Elsa looks thoughtful."}
{"text": "\u201cIsn\u2019t this development a little too fast?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Elsa."}
{"text": "Jack\u2019s a nice cute guy, what\u2019s there to lose?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuit it with your humor,\u201d Anna says as she gets up and stretches."}
{"text": "\u201cCome, let\u2019s pick out your outfit.\u201d\u2019\n\nElsa sighs, types something into her phone, and press sends,\n\n~ \n\nI\u2019ll pick you u up in front of ur building @ ~4 pm\nJack presses send and rings the doorbell in front of him."}
{"text": "\u201cJack?\u201d Tooth opens the door and eyes him up and down."}
{"text": "He\u2019s in his pajamas: a white, sweater with a giant penguin on it, and black, fuzzy sweatpants with reindeer faces all over them."}
{"text": "His dogs are out."}
{"text": "\u201cPut some shoes on, Jack.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that Jack?\u201d He hears Bunny\u2019s familiar, loud voice somewhere inside."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, please let me in!\u201d He pleads."}
{"text": "\u201cI really need your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Tooth scootches over to the side, opens the door wider and lets him in."}
{"text": "\u201cIs Sandy with you?\u201d Bunny asks as Jack beelines to their sofa."}
{"text": "For some reason, it\u2019s a lot more comfortable than the couch in his apartment."}
{"text": "(A lot cleaner too.)"}
{"text": "\u201cNo, I think he\u2019s running errands with Hiccup for tonight\u2019s party\u2014say did you know about Jamie\u2019s date today?\u201d\n\nBunny rolls his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t know about it, mate."}
{"text": "Too busy talkin\u2019 to Elsa huh?\u201d\n\nTooth laughs and Jack grumbles, \u201cHey, I was tired too man.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s up Jack?\u201d she asks him."}
{"text": "\u201cI need your help with my date in like\u2026 half an hour.\u201d\n\nBunny jokes on the tea he\u2019s drinking and Tooth scolds him."}
{"text": "\u201cHalf an hour, that\u2019 so soon!"}
{"text": "Why are you only telling us this now?\u201d\n\n\u201cCause I just asked her like twenty minutes ago,\u201d he laughs, but then he realizes the severity of the situation he\u2019s in and flips like a switch."}
{"text": "\u201cI have no idea what to wear, I haven\u2019t been on a date in so long."}
{"text": "Please help me guys.\u201d\n\nBunny lets out a huge sigh as Tooth giggles."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat am I going to do with you, Jack?"}
{"text": "How\u2019s your closet situation looking?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou know what I wear, you see me almost every day.\u201d\n\nTooth chimes in, \u201cI think it\u2019s best if you lend him something for tonight, Bunny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d Bunny agrees."}
{"text": "He gets up and starts to walk down the hall, \u201cFollow me, Jack."}
{"text": "And listen here\u2014if you spill anything on any of my clothes, you will have to replace it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on Bunny, do you know the difference between our income?\u201d\n\n~\n\n\u201cElsa, hi!\u201d \n\nShe turns to the direction of the sound."}
{"text": "Her heart swells when she sees him."}
{"text": "\u201cFor you, m\u2019lady,\u201d he grins and bows and hands her a bouquet of flowers."}
{"text": "\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she smiles and takes the bundle in her hands."}
{"text": "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have, Jackson.\u201d \n\n~\n\nThe date\u2014oh please, can he even call this a date, he really hopes it\u2019s a date, but what if she thinks it\u2019s something else\u2014goes well."}
{"text": "Now, the both of them are in the elevator, making their way up to the penthouse floor of his building."}
{"text": "\u201cWow,\u201d Elsa says casually."}
{"text": "\u201cThe penthouse.\u2019\u2019\n\nJack smirks."}
{"text": "\u201cYup, North\u2014the host of the party\u2014is pretty rich.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty is an understatement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve said this sooner, but\u2014\u201d Jack figures he should tell her before there\u2019s no more privacy for them."}
{"text": "\u201cYou look really pretty today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not pretty other times?\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s eyes widen and he\u2019s working to fix his mistake."}
{"text": "Elsa laughs and he blushes."}
{"text": "She\u2019s teasing him."}
{"text": "This woman is fucking teasing him."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re fucking gorgeous all the time, Elsa.\u201d \n\nAnd where the fuck is this confidence coming from."}
{"text": "It must\u2019ve been Christmas\u2014it\u2019s his favorite holiday after all."}
{"text": "It\u2019s Elsa\u2019s turn to flush a bright red now."}
{"text": "Jack laughs and Elsa hides her face in her hair."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t tease me like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he apologizes."}
{"text": "\u201cBut I really do mean it though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks\u2026 Jack,\u201d she finds her composure a little while later."}
{"text": "\u201cYou too, you look really good, especially tonight.\u201d\n\nDing."}
{"text": "Jack thanks the elevator."}
{"text": "Because if it didn\u2019t chime, then he would\u2019ve done something he might regret."}
{"text": "Elsa looked really pretty under the golden light, with her face in her hair, and a blushing mess."}
{"text": "~\n\n\u201cFrost is here!\u201d\n\nAs Elsa enters with Jack, someone already notices them."}
{"text": "A whistle, \u201cWho\u2019s the pretty lady Jack?\u201d Another voice asks and Jack puts his arm over her shoulders."}
{"text": "\u201cBack off, Hans,\u201d Jack shoos the guy away."}
{"text": "\u201cShe\u2019s my date tonight.\u201d\n\nRight when he said that, she feels his grip around her shoulder tighten."}
{"text": "He brings his face closer to her so she can hear him amongst the crowd."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry if I assume this is a date, if you\u2019re not comfortable with labeling it as one, please let me know.\u201d\n\nWith his face just a mere inches away from hers, she kind of wants to kiss him."}
{"text": "But she laughs and quirks her eyebrows instead, \u201cOf course it\u2019s a date, dummy.\u201d\n\n~\n\nJack sighs a sigh of relief."}
{"text": "It feels as if a semi-huge weight has been lifted off his shoulders."}
{"text": "\u201cJack!\u201d Jamie waves at him."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa!"}
{"text": "Over here,\u201d He motions for the pair to come over."}
{"text": "When they get into talking distance, Bunny tosses Jack a sweater."}
{"text": "\u201cHere ya go, mate."}
{"text": "Your ugly Christmas sweater.\u201d\n\nElsa looks amused as she watches Jack put it over his polo."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s our friend group\u2019s tradition,\u201d Tooth explains to her."}
{"text": "\u201cEvery Christmas, no matter what we\u2019re doing, we always wear ugly Christmas sweaters when we\u2019re together.\u201d\n\nThen she offers one to Elsa, \u201cWould you like to join us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, I possibly couldn\u2019t intrude on your guys\u2019s tradition.\u201d\n\nTooth smiles, \u201cOh it\u2019s okay, who knows, soon we might even be seeing you around more often.\u201d\n\nJack fucking chokes on his drink."}
{"text": "Jamie laughs."}
{"text": "Bunny looks at Tooth proudly."}
{"text": "Sandy smiles."}
{"text": "Elsa  fucking blushes."}
{"text": "~ \n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure what you mean, Tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t pay me any mind, Elsa,\u201d she keeps her smile."}
{"text": "\u201cIt would make me happy if you join us in this tradition though.\u201d\n\nElsa smiles and folds, \u201cWell if you insist.\u201d \n\nJack watches her as she takes off her coat and wiggles into the sweater."}
{"text": "And even though she\u2019s wearing something pretty modest underneath, Jack wants nothing more than to hide her from all the staring eyes."}
{"text": "(He\u2019s just selfish like that.)"}
{"text": "Sandy raises his cup and Jamie joins in and shouts, \u201cIt\u2019s fucking party time!\u201d\n\nJack holds Elsa close and laughs, \u201cMerry Christmas you motherfuckers.\u201d\n\nElsa giggles in his embrace."}
{"text": "~ \n\n\u201cThanks for the night, Jack,\u201d she smiles as she thanks him."}
{"text": "\u201cI had a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re in front of her apartment door now, in the lit lobby, it\u2019s nearing two am."}
{"text": "He hears a distant elevator chime."}
{"text": "\u201cAnytime, Elsa,\u201d Jack smiles at her."}
{"text": "\u201cWould you like to\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cHang out again sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs in\u2026\u201d he gulps."}
{"text": "\u201cGo on dates?\u201d\n\nShe smiles, \u201cYeah."}
{"text": "I\u2019d like to go on more dates with you, Jack.\u201d\n\nIs she implying something?"}
{"text": "She has to be implying something right?"}
{"text": "There\u2019s just no way she can say this and not imply something."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa, I\u2026\u201d he coughs and chokes on his next words but he\u2019s beyond the point of turning back."}
{"text": "It\u2019s almost two am, Christmas was just two hours ago, so if he doesn\u2019t do it now, then he doubts he would ever get the chance\u2014courage\u2014to again."}
{"text": "\u201cWould you like to\u2026.\u201d\n\nIs this too soon to ask her to date me?"}
{"text": "\u201cWould you like to go out with, Jack?\u201d \n\nHe blinks."}
{"text": "What."}
{"text": "\u201cHow\u2014\u201d \n\nHe sees a faint of worry in her pretty blue eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cHow did you know what I was going to ask?\u201d\n\nA pause, and then a beautiful laugh escapes her lips."}
{"text": "\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d\n\nHe joins her and laughs at their situation."}
{"text": "His hands reach out for her and pull her slender body closer\u2014into\u2014his."}
{"text": "\u201cOf course, I\u2019d be an idiot not to,\u201d he grins and leans in and kisses her."}
{"text": "\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d a familiar, singsong voice."}
{"text": "\u201cI knew I heard voices beyond the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnna!\u201d Elsa\u2019s a blushing mess and Jack laughs awkwardly because that\u2019s what he always does when he doesn\u2019t know what the fuck else to do."}
{"text": "Anna grins."}
{"text": "\u201cMerry Christmas, you too.\u201d"}
{"text": "\u201cAnna, are you sure you two aren\u2019t moving too fast?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?"}
{"text": "No, Elsa!"}
{"text": "I\u2019m one-hundred percent sure we\u2019re not,\u201d Anna responded through the video call as she threw her hands up the air in exasperation, a gesture Elsa was used to seeing from her younger sister."}
{"text": "Elsa heaved a long and loud sigh\u2014the sigh to end all sighs\u2014and surrendered herself, \u201cI\u2019m just worried about you, that\u2019s all, and\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd saying that was a mistake because even through her laptop screen, Elsa noticed how Anna\u2019s shoulders stiffened, \u201cIs this about what happened in the past?"}
{"text": "With Sideburns?\u201d\n\nNow, it was Elsa\u2019s shoulders that stiffened; she nearly amputated her thumb chopping tomatoes."}
{"text": "\u201cNo?\u201d\n\nShe hadn\u2019t meant for her answer to come off as questioningly as it did\u2014but it ended up being so anyway."}
{"text": "It was Anna\u2019s turn to sigh now, \u201cDo you not trust me, Elsa?\u201d\n\nShit."}
{"text": "And now, Elsa was left to recover from what was to come next, \u201cAnna\u2014you know I didn\u2019t mean it that way."}
{"text": "It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\n\nAnna sighed again, \u201cI know, I know, you\u2019re worried about me."}
{"text": "But Elsa, I\u2019m 20 now.\u201d\n\nElsa bit the inside of her mouth, \u201cI know, I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no longer the college freshmen I once was, Els."}
{"text": "I\u2019m older and wiser.\u201d\n\nElsa smiled at Anna\u2019s attempt at reassuring her; a good one, but an attempt nonetheless."}
{"text": "A smile found its way to her lips, \u201cYou know you were a freshman just 2 years ago, right?\u201d\n\nThe way Anna rolled her eyes at the remark didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Elsa."}
{"text": "\u201cThanks for the concern, but Kris\u2014\u201d\n\nBeep."}
{"text": "The singular beep was followed by a louder one and then\u2014\n\nAnd then the lights to her apartment went out, along with her sister\u2019s face on her laptop screen."}
{"text": "Elsa blinked once; then twice."}
{"text": "It took her longer than it really should\u2019ve to comprehend what had happened to figure out that it was a blackout."}
{"text": "Squinting her eyes a few times to adjust to what light was remaining inside of her Manhattan apartment, she felt around the kitchen counter for her phone; her conversation with Anna was not going to be put on hold just because some fool had one too many things running\u2014but to be honest\u2014she could care less about the cause of the blackout."}
{"text": "Eventually, she grabbed hold of the familiar device and picked it up; however, the screen wasn\u2019t turning on."}
{"text": "Losing nothing but just a little bit of patience\u2014and hope\u2014she pressed firmly on the power button."}
{"text": "After a few (awfully long) seconds, her screen flashed a light flash, and the dreaded picture of a battery with a sliver of flashing red appeared."}
{"text": "\u201cShit,\u201d an expletive finally escaped her mind."}
{"text": "Letting out yet another exasperated sigh, she felt around her tables again for her keys this time."}
{"text": "And Elsa went out her door."}
{"text": "\u2014--\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mid mate what the fuck, why is he mid?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming Bunny,\u201d a soft voice replied."}
{"text": "\u201cTooth!\u201d Jack called after her over their Discord call."}
{"text": "\u201cI can\u2019t just lane by my\u2014shit the jungler\u2019s here\u2014their jungler\u2019s here!"}
{"text": "Tooth!"}
{"text": "Come back please.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m already halfway through the river, Jack\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear to god mate,\u201d Bunny started."}
{"text": "Jack could hear some form of snort through his headset, which\u2014he could only guess\u2014was from the man, the legend, the mid-laner himself: Bunny."}
{"text": "\u201cNow you know how I felt when your fucking supp\u2014\u201d\n\nBeep."}
{"text": "The singular beep was followed by a louder one and then\u2014\n\nAnd then Jack was sitting in front of his now turned-off monitor, basking in the newfound darkness of his apartment."}
{"text": "\u201cShit,\u201d he murmured to himself as he looked for his phone\u2014he swore to god it was somewhere on his desk\u2014at least he hoped it was."}
{"text": "Luckily, he was able to find the device sooner than he anticipated\u2014it was thanks to the onslaught of the familiar ring of discord notifications from his friends, whom he was just playing with before his world was engulfed in black; the clearest sign of a blackout."}
{"text": "Bunz: Where the fuck did you go?"}
{"text": "aToothz: @Frost ?"}
{"text": "??"}
{"text": "J-me: Actually inting us for real, huh????"}
{"text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a blackout in my apartment building,\u201d he mumbled his response to the group out loud."}
{"text": "\u201cGood luck winning the 4v5 without me bozos,\u201d he smirked at a remark well made\u2014he could tell Bunny was fuming right now."}
{"text": "He could just imagine the lad\u2019s feet tapping viciously\u2014a habit he could never not remind Bunny of."}
{"text": "He proceeded to rid his hand of his phone, took off his headset, got up from his chair, and walked towards his window; a full-wall window that opened up the beautiful city of Manhattan to him."}
{"text": "He pulled up the blinds."}
{"text": "His face grimaced at the sight: one of the liveliest and bustling cities of the night was no longer lively."}
{"text": "It was probably still bustling\u2014but he couldn\u2019t tell\u2014because, as his apartment, the city was too, blanketed in darkness; in an almost eery pitch-black."}
{"text": "The young adult traveled back to his desk and reached for his phone, intending to tell his friends\u2014\n\nRing."}
{"text": "But he guessed answering the door could come first."}
{"text": "\u2014-\n\nRing."}
{"text": "Elsa stepped back and looked up at the door across from hers nervously."}
{"text": "She stood in the empty hallway, both palms intertwined, fingers feeling each other, tapping her left foot for the sake of having something to focus on, and lightly biting her lips."}
{"text": "Was her neighbor-from-across-the-hall\u2019s door always this big and domineering?"}
{"text": "Or was it just the lack of light that made it seem so?"}
{"text": "Or was it because this was\u2014will be\u2014the first time she will actually converse with him?"}
{"text": "Obviously, she\u2019s seen him around\u2014sometimes."}
{"text": "And looking back, she did (technically) talk to him once."}
{"text": "Of course, he approached her first and all\u2014offering her a plate of cookies because he had just moved in and that was, quite frankly, the friendly neighborhood thing to do."}
{"text": "Then why the hell was she so nervous now?"}
{"text": "He wasn\u2019t weird or anything."}
{"text": "She bit her lips again; she figured it must\u2019ve been the lack of light."}
{"text": "Damn this blackout."}
{"text": "\u201cDamn this blackout indeed.\u201d\n\nHer eyes widened and she whipped her head up and away from the oh-so-interesting floor."}
{"text": "Did I say that out loud?"}
{"text": "The man standing under the threshold blinked, then laughed a light laugh, \u201cYou did, indeed, say that out loud,\u201d He paused."}
{"text": "\u201cYou were thinking out loud twice, actually.\u201d\n\nShe bit her lips again and leveled her gaze; she figured she didn\u2019t need to pursue any more eye contact."}
{"text": "Their height difference and darkness made it hard\u2014too hard\u2014to do so anyway."}
{"text": "It totally wasn\u2019t the embarrassment\u2014nope\u2014it would take her more than some uncontrollable form of emotion to meddle with her professionalism."}
{"text": "Well, it\u2019s actually a lack of professionalism now."}
{"text": "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\nAnd I should stop talking out loud."}
{"text": "He laughed a louder laugh this time, \u201cYou really should.\u201d And then he chose to save her from any more slip-ups, \u201cElsa, right?"}
{"text": "Did you need anything?\u201d\n\nAnd if her cheeks ever did turn a slight shade of pink, then she thanked the blackout for rendering it nearly impossible for the man before her to see so."}
{"text": "\u201cYes, actually,\u201d she extended a slim hand out to him."}
{"text": "He blinked."}
{"text": "\u201cY\u2019know, the one from across the hall,\u201d she coughed."}
{"text": "\u201cQuite literally, from across the hall.\u201d\n\nThe man laughed again."}
{"text": "Holy shit, does this dude laugh at everything?"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Jack,\u201d his hand reached for hers."}
{"text": "\u201cJackson,\u201d she felt his fingertips on her hand."}
{"text": "\u201cJackson Overland,\u201d his fingers morphed around her palm."}
{"text": "\u201cBut no one really calls me that unless you\u2019re my angry mother or someone who works for the government,\u201d and he shook her hand."}
{"text": "\u201cI know.\u201c\n\nHe smiled, still holding onto her hand, \u201cI\u2019m glad you remembered.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyways,\u201d he relaxed and pulled away."}
{"text": "\u201cDid you need something, Elsa?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I was wondering if\u2014\u201d and she was starting to think this may have been more trouble than it was worth."}
{"text": "But she was already halfway through with the plan."}
{"text": "\u201cIf you had a spare portable charger or something\u2014one that doesn\u2019t need charging by the way\u2014like\u2014\u201d\n\nHe laughed again."}
{"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I know what you mean.\u201d\n\nHe turned a little away from the door, \u201cYou wanted to see if you can borrow a portable charger with juice left in it, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2014Yes, please.\u201d \n\n\u201cI have one but I\u2019ll just have to see if it\u2019s functional,\u201d he stepped away from the door."}
{"text": "\u201cBe right back.\u201d\n\nElsa nodded and muffled a quick \u2018thank you\u2019 before he completely left her sight."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nJack dug around his belongings and drawers looking for the portable charger he was tasked to find."}
{"text": "Eventually\u2014after what took 2 minutes but felt more like an eternity because he kept someone waiting\u2014he found it."}
{"text": "Bringing his phone out of his pocket, he plugged the wire in."}
{"text": "Nothing."}
{"text": "His face fell and he tried again."}
{"text": "Unplug."}
{"text": "Plug."}
{"text": "Unplug."}
{"text": "Plug."}
{"text": "Unplug the wire."}
{"text": "Move it to the other side of the device."}
{"text": "Plug."}
{"text": "Still nothing."}
{"text": "Finally accepting that the portable doesn\u2019t have any more juice in it\u2014or maybe it was just broken, who the hell knows, he hadn\u2019t used this thing in a long time\u2014he made his way back to the door."}
{"text": "He didn\u2019t want to keep his very attractive\u2014stop it\u2014neighbor waiting any longer."}
{"text": "\u201cEls\u2014\u201d\n\nThe girl looked up from the floor."}
{"text": "He nervously looked at her hopeful expression, afraid to be the reason it doesn\u2019t last, \u201cUm\u2026\u201d the next few words stopped midway through his throat."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint but,\u201d he scratched the nape of his neck, a sure-fire sign of nervousness, and held the device in his hand up for her to see."}
{"text": "\u201cThis thing doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t miss the glint of disappointment in her eyes\u2014even without the aid of lights."}
{"text": "The faintest curve of a line traced her lips, \u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d \n\nHe wanted to say something more."}
{"text": "\u201cSorry for the trouble,\u201d she didn\u2019t let him continue."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll be taking my leave no\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d \n\nShe halted mid-turn and looked back at him, newly painted confusion and expectancy splattered her face."}
{"text": "He gulped and relived the all too familiar tense in his muscles and felt heat rush to his cheeks."}
{"text": "\u201cYes\u2026\u201d she looked back up at him, hopeful."}
{"text": "\u201cJack?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm\u2014\u201c he coughed and cleared his throat, unsure of what to say next."}
{"text": "But right as he opened his mouth again, his stomach decided to do the talking for him."}
{"text": "Growl."}
{"text": "She jerked in surprise at the sudden sound and immediately looked down\u2014it wasn\u2019t at the floor this time though\u2014(to Jack\u2019s dismay)."}
{"text": "Almost as quickly, he followed her line of sight as a new wave of heat rushed to his cheeks; this time, because of another reason\u2014a reason Jack doesn\u2019t want to think about."}
{"text": "Ever."}
{"text": "\u201cAheh\u2026\u201d a lame chuckle escaped his slightly quivering lips."}
{"text": "Any slim chance he thought he had with her was long gone now."}
{"text": "He wanted to shit his pants of embarrassment."}
{"text": "She looked back up at him\u2014and holy fuck is that a teasing look in her eyes?"}
{"text": "Stop it Jack\u2014\u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t have dinner yet?\u201d\n\nHe laughed again, this time, more so to save himself the little face he had left."}
{"text": "\u201cDing!"}
{"text": "You guessed right.\u201d\n\nHe scurried to close the door almost right after, \u201cSuper sorry about that Elsa, I\u2019ll lea\u2014excuse myself now\u2014y\u2019know\u2014 to feed my sorry as\u2014self\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Her hand reached out to stop him."}
{"text": "It was tugging at his shirt."}
{"text": "Holy fucking shit she\u2019s\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nI\u2019m tugging his shirt."}
{"text": "Immediately, the once regal lady tucked her hand back to where it belonged: at her side."}
{"text": "She scrambled to apologize almost right after, \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m so sorry about that."}
{"text": "Holy sh\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to be so rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jack smiled a reassuring smile."}
{"text": "\u201cSo was there something else you needed?\u201d\n\n\u201cAc\u2014\u201c Elsa looked down at the ground again and tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear."}
{"text": "\u201cActually, I was wondering if you wanted to eat dinner with me\u2014you see\u2014I always tend to cook more than enough for one so\u2014\u201c\n\nAnd then she looked up, \u201cBut it\u2019s fine if you already had something in the oven or something\u2014\u201c she stopped and seemed to reconsider something."}
{"text": "\u201cActually\u2014\u201c\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cForget I as\u2014\u201c \n\nJack smiled a beaming smile and interrupted her before she retracted her offer, \u201cHell yeah, Elsa."}
{"text": "I would love to.\u201d \n\nGood job, this stomach of mine."}
{"text": "\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cReally.\u201d \n\nShe couldn\u2019t see herself, but she was sure Jack\u2019s smile was mirrored on her face."}
{"text": "\u201cT\u2014That\u2019s fantastic, Jack!"}
{"text": "Would you like to go to my place?"}
{"text": "Or yours?"}
{"text": "Either way, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make that much a difference\u2014y\u2019know\u2014city-wide blackout and all.\u201d\n\nJack thought about it for a while before he suggested another place that crossed his mind, \u201cActually, how do you feel about our building's rooftop?\u201d\n\nShe looked thoughtful."}
{"text": "\u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s tota\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo Jack, I think that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d she was still smiling."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s about time we utilize the things our building offers in the rent contract."}
{"text": "Five thousand dollars a month is far from cheap\u2014even for a skyscraper building in Manhattan.\u201d\n\nJack laughed at her (attempted) joke, \u201cYou\u2019re right."}
{"text": "It\u2019s about time I go outside today."}
{"text": "My friend, Bunny would be proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she smiled again as she looked down at her watch."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s almost eight-thirty now but\u2014but we\u2019ll be fine."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nJack smiled again."}
{"text": "He knew they would be."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll meet you back here in fifteen minutes?"}
{"text": "There are some last-minute things that need to be done,\u201d She was counting the many things to do on her fingers now, mumbling some sort of mumbo-jumbo, Jack couldn\u2019t guess."}
{"text": "Cute."}
{"text": "\u201cAwesome,\u201d Jack should really fucking stop smiling."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the blanket and other things we might need\u2014like flashlights\u2014I would totally bring candles but I think there\u2019s a light gust of wind outside."}
{"text": "Accidents in the dark are the worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be great!\u201d She beamed at the idea of a picnic on the rooftop and Jack couldn\u2019t help but notice the way her loose braid followed her movements\u2014so subtle and perfe\u2014it perfectly suited her."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll bring the utensils and food.\u201d\n\nJack nodded and\u2014\n\nAnd he fucking smiled again."}
{"text": "How many times was that now?"}
{"text": "Holy fucking hell she\u2019s going to think he\u2019s a psycho or something."}
{"text": "It took every ounce of his present willpower to not ruffle his hair in nervousness."}
{"text": "\u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d He responded diligently instead."}
{"text": "Elsa was at the front of her door now, subtly unlocking it."}
{"text": "\u201cPerfect, I\u2019ll see you in fifteen then.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and closed himself behind the door of his apartment, only after hearing the secure click and lock of hers."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nElsa eyed the wall clock hung\u2014more like laid\u2014strategically next to her microwave: 8:38, 2 minutes before the 15 was up."}
{"text": "She bit her lips as she looked at the eggs frying in her pan, which were in their last few seconds before completion."}
{"text": "She let out a breath of relief she didn\u2019t know she was holding."}
{"text": "Time feels infinitesimal when you have someone waiting for you at the end of it."}
{"text": "After turning off the fire, she took her spatula and frantically clipped them between their respective sandwich slices, spraying them with a bit of soy sauce before closing them up and performing a clean diagonal slice."}
{"text": "She scurried a little more around her house, but before the longest hand on the clock could reach the number 12 a second time, Elsa was already out the door."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nClick."}
{"text": "Jack looked up from his phone and grinned realizing it was the opening (and closing) of the door across from his."}
{"text": "\u201cOh my,\u201d Elsa turned around."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re right on time,\u201d he turned off his phone and grinned at her."}
{"text": "Consequently, his eyes shifted from hers to the basket she was carrying, \u201cThat smells good, what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I told you, I would be ruining the element of surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, it wasn\u2019t me asking.\u201d He paused."}
{"text": "\u201cIt was my stomach.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him weirdly\u2014with a hint of amusement\u2014but mostly weirdly."}
{"text": "\u201cNice try, Jackson.\u201d\n\nJack chuckled as he picked up his pace to start walking beside her\u2014instead of a few steps behind."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd all of a sudden, you\u2019re my mother.\u201d\n\nElsa shrugged and smiled as she made her way to the flight of stairs at the end of the hall."}
{"text": "Naturally, he followed her."}
{"text": "To be quite frank, he never even knew their floor had a set of stairs\u2014but thinking back\u2014it would not have been great if they were without one either."}
{"text": "But who was he to know?"}
{"text": "The thought to use them never crossed his mind before; because, besides the awkward exchanges with people you technically live with, the making sure your posture is good\u2014at least good enough\u2014when in the presence of others, and the mindlessly scrolling through your photos to avoid a conversation about the weather, much less eye contact, elevators were a tenfold times better."}
{"text": "Because at least he wouldn\u2019t have to walk."}
{"text": "\u201cHow far do you think we\u2019ll have to walk?\u201d Elsa mumbled and stopped to look up, hoping to gauge how many more steps they had to overcome."}
{"text": "\u201cI think we\u2019re on floor 14\u2026?\u201c Jack wasn\u2019t really sure himself."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd there\u2019s like 20 stories, soo\u2026\u201d he dragged out the word."}
{"text": "\u201cSo there are about 6 flights of stairs to climb,\u201d Elsa finished it for him."}
{"text": "\u201cDammit.\u201d \n\nJack smirked at her choice of words."}
{"text": "He didn\u2019t take her for someone who would use expletives on the daily\u2014or such words at all."}
{"text": "\u201cI can help you carry the basket,\u201d he offered."}
{"text": "She stopped and turned back to look at him."}
{"text": "He realized he had to look up to meet her eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s quite alright,\u201d she smiled and continued her pillage."}
{"text": "\u201cBut\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already holding a lot anyways,\u201d she said without turning back this time."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s really no trouble at all though, Elsa.\u201d\n\nJack was beside her now, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want any help with that?\u201d\n\nShe looked smugly at him, \u201cAnd have you look at what\u2019s inside?\u201d \n\nHe coughed."}
{"text": "\u201cNo thank you.\u201d\n\nOh well, you can\u2019t fault him for trying."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nCreak."}
{"text": "Elsa stepped over the threshold and onto the rooftop, basket in hand."}
{"text": "Jack whistled at her side."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd to think I\u2019ve never been up here before.\u201d\n\nAnd even though it was too dark to see the entirety of it, she smiled in agreement from what she could see."}
{"text": "\u201cNot too bad for a rooftop.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too bad?\u201d Jack side-eyed her."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a great ass rooftop Elsa.\u201d \n\nAs if to back up his claim, he pointed to their left, \u201cLook at those lounge chairs.\u201d And then to their right, \u201cLook at that pool!\u201d\n\nElsa all but laughed at him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s find a place to settle down.\u201d \n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cSo can you finally tell me what\u2019s for dinner now?\u201d Jack asked as soon as he made himself comfortable on their picnic cloth; but really it was just something he found at the furthest corner of his closet\u2014the one dedicated to sheets and pillowcases and bed commodities (only because his apartment was big enough for one)."}
{"text": "\u201cSure,\u201d Elsa said as she, too, settled down on the blanket next to him\u2014a little too close, he thought."}
{"text": "\u201cIf you had any expectations, it\u2019s best to lower them now,\u201d she warned."}
{"text": "\u201cWon\u2019t need to.\u201d \n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she beckoned him to come closer to her opened basket."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not a gourmet meal or anything; I only cook to relieve my stress.\u201d\n\nJack leaned over and peaked inside the open basket, \u201cWell, for a stress-reliever, you\u2019re one hell of a good chef.\u201d\n\nShe quirked her left eyebrow and rolled her eyes at his flattery, \u201cPlease, you haven\u2019t even tasted it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Jack shrugged."}
{"text": "\u201cThe smell and presentation are just as important as the taste; it\u2019s what makes a difference between a good chef and a great chef.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nJack noticed the amused look Elsa gave him."}
{"text": "\u201cAt least that\u2019s what my friend Jamie tells me all the time\u2014he\u2019s a food critic,\u201d Jack added."}
{"text": "\u201cImagine not only getting to eat good food but also getting paid for it,\u201d Elsa said in jealousy while she worked to empty the basket of its contents."}
{"text": "\u201cRight?"}
{"text": "!\u201d Jack guffawed."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd even after all that, he still wouldn\u2019t refer me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she handed him a sandwich."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you think your taste buds are sensitive enough?"}
{"text": "What about your ability to put the taste into words?\u201d\n\nHe took the sandwich and gave her a muffled thanks, \u201cI guess not."}
{"text": "But what kind of person would I be if I didn\u2019t at least try?"}
{"text": "And what kind of person is he to not even refer me\u2014his best friend?"}
{"text": "!\u201d\n\nHe took a bite of his sandwich and his face (quite literally) lit up, \u201cHoly shit, this is a good sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cPff\u2014\u201d Elsa covered her snort with an open palm."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s literally just soy sauce, eggs, and a couple of tomato and cucumber slices.\u201d\n\n\u201cA combo I never thought of trying but would kill for a taste of again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, I guess?\u201d Elsa wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say to that."}
{"text": "\u201cMy sister taught me it\u2014and I guess she learned it from her boyfriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sister?\u201d Jack questioned."}
{"text": "\u201cThe strawberry-blonde person who always visits you, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2014Yeah,\u201d Elsa\u2019s eyes rounded."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve seen her a\u2026 round?\u201d And really, she was only assuming."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve heard more than I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Jack corrected her."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know, for how expensive and high-class our apartment complex is, you\u2019d expect thicker walls.\u201d\n\nElsa smiled knowingly, \u201cWell, expensive or not, no wall can really contain her excitement and such.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe seems like quite the character.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and her would get along.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould we?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know the thin walls thing works both ways, right?\u201d\n\nShe was right; it does."}
{"text": "He couldn\u2019t see her face that well in the pitch black but judging from her tone, he could tell she was smirking, \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoy your time with your friends though.\u201d\n\nHis cheeks grew hot and a sweat formed at the side of his forehead."}
{"text": "\u201cJust don\u2019t stay up too late though.\u201d\n\nJack laughed a nervous\u2014and quite frankly, an embarrassed\u2014laugh."}
{"text": "\u201cThanks for the thought.\u201d He coughed a bit on the former bite of food traveling down his throat."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nElsa couldn\u2019t tell how much time had passed since they got here\u2014but\u2014she could at least tell that the hours had indeed moved quite a bit just from the stings of chills she felt through her jacket."}
{"text": "And she hadn\u2019t meant for her slight shiver to go heard."}
{"text": "\u201cAre you cold?\u201d Jack asked from her side."}
{"text": "\u201cN\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he handed her his blue hoodie."}
{"text": "\u201cYou can put this on."}
{"text": "Despite how it looks, it\u2019s actually quite warm.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t sure whether or not Jack could see the subtle movement, but she nonetheless shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, just slightly chilly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need it more than I do,\u201d she countered."}
{"text": "\u201cPlus, it wouldn\u2019t be fair if I double-layered when you\u2019re only gonna be in a t-shirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fine though.\u201d\n\nShe saw his head quirk to the side."}
{"text": "I guess we really can see each other\u2019s movements in the dark."}
{"text": "\u201cThe cold doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you shivered.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because I thought about the temperature drop.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nJack squinted his eyes in confusion at what she said, \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does if you think about it hard enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAhuh\u2026\u201d\n\nShe held a slightly desperate tone now, \u201cIt\u2019s similar to when your body physically cringes if you think about something really\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCringeworthy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 cringeworthy\u2014but I was looking for a more technical term.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Jack was beyond confused now."}
{"text": "He had no idea where this conversation was going\u2014he could roll with it\u2014but that didn\u2019t mean he knew where it was going."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, I\u2019m not really bothered by the cold either.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cSo you should wear the hoodie.\u201d\n\nElsa blinked at him."}
{"text": "Truth be told, she was a little cold, but nowhere near enough for it to be an inconvenience for her."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m gonna get nowhere arguing with you over this, right?\u201d\n\nShe could hear the smile tucked between his words, \u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d \n\n\u2014\n\nHe smiled a triumphant smile."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nIf Elsa never had doubts about taking his hoodie, she was having them now."}
{"text": "Even through two semi-thick layers, she could feel the continuing drop in temperature as the night got\u2014well\u2014nighter."}
{"text": "She wasn\u2019t sure what the hell to do."}
{"text": "Was he cold?"}
{"text": "Should she say something about the temperature?"}
{"text": "Or would it just remind him that he was cold?"}
{"text": "Is he going to awkwardly ask for it back?"}
{"text": "Sure she wouldn\u2019t make the confrontation awkward\u2014not intentionally at least\u2014\n\n\u201cThe stars are pretty tonight,\u201d his words brought Elsa back from her trailing thoughts."}
{"text": "Their dinner was long finished and they were laying down on their backs now, with nothing to do and nowhere to look but up at the sky."}
{"text": "She let him continue, \u201cAlthough you can\u2019t really see much because of the pollution.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least the blackout made some visible.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t need to turn her face to him to know that he shrugged, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe smiled in turn, \u201cDo you like the sky?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike is an understatement."}
{"text": "I love the night sky\u2014hell I can even point out the planets we can see and name the stars and constellations\u2014visible or not.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t miss the blooming excitement in his throat and tone."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\n\u201cSometimes, I just wish I can become one with the wind and trust it to take me wherever, whenever, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\nAnd Jack wasn\u2019t sure why he was telling his childhood dreams to someone whom he had just gotten the pleasure of knowing only a few hours ago; but here he was, spilling all his unsaid thoughts and hopes and imagination to said someone."}
{"text": "\u201cI get that.\u201d\n\nHe felt the familiar traces of a growing smile."}
{"text": "\u201cYup, wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if we could do just that?\u201d\n\nElsa sighed a contented sigh and added to their imagined possibility, \u201cAnd leave the world and expectations and responsibility behind and do whatever we wanted to\u2014if only just for a night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jack started as he unwillingly pulled himself up and stretched."}
{"text": "\u201cThe blackout wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d He extended a hand out to her."}
{"text": "\u201cConsidering we sort of did just that.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cWe did?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Elsa,\u201d he smirked a knowing smirk at what was to come next."}
{"text": "\u201cWe sort of did if you think about it hard enough.\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s words were left lingering in the air for a few seconds, but before Elsa could find the chance to respond\u2014all of a sudden\u2014the many lights that were once killed, lit up again."}
{"text": "And if Elsa hadn\u2019t known any better\u2014if she hadn\u2019t known what they were\u2014she would dare think they were stars; the same ones in the sky, far beyond their lifetimes."}
{"text": "Rather than saying anything, she took his hand and pulled herself up."}
{"text": "\u201cWow,\u201d Jack breathed as he looked over the ledge and onto the city of Manhattan, in all its entirety and lights and liveliness once again."}
{"text": "\u201cThe million dollar view is better from up here, huh?\u201d Elsa sighed next to him."}
{"text": "\u201cYup,\u201d Jack smiled."}
{"text": "And for a while, the two of them didn\u2019t feel the need or pressure to do anything; letting time simply pass by around them was okay too."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time we get back, right?\u201d Jack questioned as he turned to his neighbor."}
{"text": "He then looked at his phone, \u201cGod, it\u2019s almost 2 am.\u201d\n\nElsa sighed a tired sigh and let a light laugh slip through, \u201cWe really should.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut staying up here is okay too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d she hummed in agreement."}
{"text": "\u201cHow about a few more minutes?\u201d\n\n\u201cA few more minutes.\u201d\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t help but smile again for the millionth time that night."}
{"text": "To be completely honest, his cheeks were starting to get sore\u2014just a little though."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d Elsa hadn\u2019t meant for it to sound like a question, but it also would\u2019ve been weird if it was a factual statement\u2014she wasn\u2019t quite sure where their relationship stands, nor was she aware of his daytime schedule to assume so either."}
{"text": "Regrettably."}
{"text": "\u201cHuh?\u201d \n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d her cheek flushed and she tightened her fingers around the handle of her basket."}
{"text": "\u201cBut yeah,\u201d the man smiled."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d she said, a little too enthusiastic."}
{"text": "She bit her tongue to distract herself from how atrociously cringeworthy she was being right now."}
{"text": "He could probably see how red her face was."}
{"text": "Damn these lights."}
{"text": "\u201cOkay,\u201d he echoed and bit back a laugh\u2014if she was running her mind again, then he didn\u2019t say it out loud."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow then?\u201d\n\nShe smiled a lopsided and awkward smile, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you.\u201d\n\nHe mirrored her smile\u2014awkwardness and all\u2014and stood in front of his open door for a few more seconds."}
{"text": "\u201cBye.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAnd holy shit if that wasn\u2019t the most awkward goodbye Jack had ever had the pleasure of living through."}
{"text": "Why so awkward, Jack?"}
{"text": "Because he didn\u2019t really want their time to end."}
{"text": "He let out a sigh he was holding for the entirety of the exchange after he was finally behind his closed doors."}
{"text": "Now would be as good as a time to finally go through his messages and respond to his concerned (upset) friends."}
{"text": "J-me: Jack, are you coming back?"}
{"text": "Bunz: you\u2019re gonna hear it from me when you come back, Frost."}
{"text": "aToothz: I just looked it up, holy shit the whole city\u2019s in a blackout\u2026 are you okay?!"}
{"text": "Bunz: @frostyboiii\n\nJ-me: @frostyboiii are you okay?"}
{"text": "Are you dead?"}
{"text": "aToothz: should I drive to his apartment and check up on him?"}
{"text": "Sand-man: \ud83d\ude45\n\nJ-me: oKay, it\u2019s been 4 hours, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s dead \n\nBunz: I don\u2019t doubt that LMAO\n\naToothz: guys, what if something did happen to him?"}
{"text": "Bunz: well, we\u2019ll never know now would we?"}
{"text": "J-me: I\u2019ll drop by his apartment on my way to that new restaurant tomorrow."}
{"text": "Bunz: inb4 you find his body \n\naToothz: \ud83d\ude2d \n\nfrostboiii: guys, chill, I\u2019m right here\nAlive and healthy \n\nBunz: Unfortunately\n\nJ-me: welcome back\n\nfrostboiii: AWEE bunny you don\u2019t mean that\n\nJ-me: I think tooth\u2019s asleep rn but\nMind filling us in on\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Elsa?"}
{"text": "!\u201d Anna exclaimed in bewilderment."}
{"text": "Elsa could very much see the widening of her sister\u2019s hazel-colored eyes through the screen."}
{"text": "\u201cSlow down Anna!"}
{"text": "I\u2019ll fill you in on everything\u201d."}
{"text": "\u201cYou fucking better, Elsa!"}
{"text": "I was worried sick!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for the tenth time tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get that it\u2019s a blackout Elsa but, radio silence\u2014for well over four hours now,\u201d Anna said exasperatedly."}
{"text": "\u201cIn the middle of the fucking night no less!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I told you my phone was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen?"}
{"text": "That\u2019s no excuse bro, you should\u2019ve went asking for a portable!\u201d\n\nElsa snorted\u2014she didn\u2019t mean to snort at her sister\u2019s lecture\u2014but she did, \u201cFunnily enough, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho did you ask?\u201c Anna\u2019s worrisome tone was replaced with a curious one now."}
{"text": "\u201cMy neighbor from\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nAcross the hall,\u201d Jack said out loud to himself as he pressed enter."}
{"text": "J-me: the same one who u gushed about when you first moved in?"}
{"text": "Bunz: he did WHAT?!"}
{"text": "frostboiii: great Jamie, now the whole world knows."}
{"text": "Bunz: why didn\u2019t I know of this before?"}
{"text": "Huh?"}
{"text": "Jack\nJamie?!!"}
{"text": "Does tooth know?"}
{"text": "frostboiii: that\u2019s not important right now\nLet me continue the story\n\nJ-me: yeah let him continue\n\nfrostboiii: okay so\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014that\u2019s pretty much what happened,\u201d Elsa was changed into her pajamas now and was sitting cross-legged on her bed, with her personal  MacBook sitting in front of her."}
{"text": "\u201cHoly shit holy shit holy fucking shit!\u201d Anna squealed into her phone and Elsa removed one of her AirPods to avoid the ear rape from both ears."}
{"text": "\u201cIs he cute?"}
{"text": "!\u201d \n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hesitated, so you do find him cute!!"}
{"text": "!\u201d\n\nElsa swore she heard at least 5 exclamation points at the end of it."}
{"text": "\u201cIs he\u2026\u201d and even though she was in the kitchen (so as to not disturb her sleeping boyfriend) Anna lowered her voice an octave or three."}
{"text": "\u201c\u2026hot?\u201d\n\nTo which Elsa reluctantly nodded; lying to Anna\u2014especially about this certain topic\u2014was something behind her now."}
{"text": "A few years behind."}
{"text": "\u201cHoly fucking shit, Elsa!\u201d And whatever efforts were made to lower her voice was left in vain."}
{"text": "\u201cLanguage, Anna.\u201d\n\n\u201cPuh-lease bro, I\u2019ve more or less been cursing this whole call.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I bet Kristoff can use less of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Anna waved her free hand."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll hear about him tomorrow, tonight\u2014or the rest of tonight\u2014is for you.\u201d\n\nElsa laughed, \u201cWhat about me?"}
{"text": "I\u2019ve pretty much gone and told you all of it.\u201d\n\nAnna pouted, \u201cNot everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?"}
{"text": "Ask away then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014I THINK OF HER?"}
{"text": "!\u201d Jack shouted as he read the new message that appeared at the bottom of his chat logs."}
{"text": "And then, almost reflexively, he gasped and brought his hand over his mouth."}
{"text": "What are the chances that Elsa\u2019s awake?"}
{"text": "What are the chances that she heard that?"}
{"text": "What are the chances she concludes that it\u2019s about her (with good reasoning too)?"}
{"text": "frostboiii: HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIRH TOU BNNY I FUCKING SWEAR TO GOD TOU ARE SO GONA GET IT FROM ME RHE NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER \n\nJack was typing in all caps now\u2014and even though Bunny couldn\u2019t hear his anger\u2014he at least should be able to tell just how fucking pissed Jackson Frost Overland was\u2014caps and all."}
{"text": "J-me: relax Jack\n\nfrostboiii: BEJFJKSKWKD I CSNT\n\nBunz: what even happened m8, I did nothing\n\nfrostboiii: I fuckijg yelled your text at the top of my lungs and she prob heard it \nwait."}

{"text": "frostboiii: well\nI\nI think she\u2019s a very attractive person with an even more attractive\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014personality.\u201d\n\nAnna chuckled at her sister\u2019s description of the man in question, \u201cYou genuinely think he\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\nElsa nodded, \u201cIn his own way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t see that every day, I never thought I\u2019d see the day my sister would find anyone funny.\u201d\n\nElsa quirked her lips, clearly unimpressed."}
{"text": "\u201cSo are you guys friends?\u201d\n\nElsa went silent for a moment, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not quite sure."}
{"text": "I don\u2019t know what he considers me as.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter going through all that, I\u2019m sure you guys are at least friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh gosh, I hope so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about plans?"}
{"text": "Did\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014we make any plans?\u201d\n\nBunz: what the hell else did I ask, m8 \n\nJ-me: ngl Jack I think the sleep deprivation and grass touching got to you."}
{"text": "frostboiii: stfu\nAnd no we didn\u2019t make any more\n\nBunz: aweeeee, even after your great time together on the rooftop?"}
{"text": "J-me: did she reject you?"}

{"text": "!\u201d\n\nElsa hasn\u2019t got a damn clue where she gets her crazy fantasies and\u2014quite frankly\u2014her imaginative imagination from."}
{"text": "Because Elsa was the exact opposite: down to earth and pessimistic and real."}
{"text": "Suffice to say, it has been a few months since her new neighbor had moved in\u2014more specifically, five months and a week\u2014but no one knows she was counting the damn days."}
{"text": "Because sure, sure\u2014she admits it\u2014her neighbor is drop-dead fucking gorgeous."}
{"text": "Whenever her thoughts were trailing, they would always, without a single fail, settle on the idea of his fluffy (messy) white hair, his ice blue (mesmerizing) eyes, his sharp (Greek god) jawline\u2014and really her head can probably go on and on and on if given enough time to do so."}
{"text": "But whenever she finds her mind losing itself, she would always beeline to the sink and slap a handful of cold water onto her face."}
{"text": "A much needed reality check."}
{"text": "She then forces herself to remember the many kinds of women he would bring into his apartment\u2014and reminds herself of the painful fact that those are the times she\u2019s seen him\u2014he could very well be bringing three or four times as many as that."}
{"text": "But she ends up questioning that thought because\u2014at the end of the day\u2014she doesn\u2019t need to see him to know."}
{"text": "Other times, she can hear it."}
{"text": "And Elsa is a dignified woman, so a crush is what she will always let it be."}
{"text": "Now, five months and a week in, she finds herself sitting at the corner of her bed in one of her many, many, pairs of one of her more\u2014\u2018revealing\u2019 pajamas, toes curling and uncurling themselves in her snowman slippers, sending Anna a good night text."}
{"text": "She settles down and closes her eyes."}
{"text": "Beep beep beep."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\nShe hides her yawn behind an open palm as she stands on the street\u2014in her (let\u2019s be real) lingerie and (soon to be no longer) white snowman slippers."}
{"text": "There were dozens\u2014hundreds\u2014of people stranded and idly standing on the empty streets of New York City, all confused and probably thinking the same damn thing: why the fuck am I here?"}
{"text": "She sighs to herself and crosses her arms against her (immodest) chest and tries her best to tunnel her vision to her slippers."}
{"text": "Because if she looks anywhere else, her eyes will one hundred fucking percent, choose to settle to the man on her left: Jackson Overland fucking Frost."}
{"text": "But she finds it hard not to steal a glance\u2014or four."}
{"text": "And just as quickly, her eyes would always, without fail, dart back to her feet; and she wiggles her toes a bit to distract herself from her wild, dirty, thoughts."}
{"text": "Because \n\nJackson Overland fucking Frost\u2014as Anna likes to call him\u2014was ridiculously hot; there is no other way to be modest about it and he just so happens to be about of similar age to her (thanks Safari)."}
{"text": "Said hot dude is standing right next to her; but if she is to get technical about it, they are still a foot apart."}
{"text": "But still, he can probably hear her poor heart hyperventilate from their single foot apart."}
{"text": "He is in his underwear."}
{"text": "She repeats: he is in his fucking boxers; with snowflake patterns on them."}
{"text": "And she thinks that it\u2019s cute\u2014she groans at that thought."}
{"text": "All the women (and some men)\u2014single or not\u2014were ogling him too."}
{"text": "And as the dignified woman she is, she doesn\u2019t want to be a part of that group (though there is no shame\u2014because really\u2014she understands, probably more than anyone)."}
{"text": "She can\u2019t seem to forget about the bulge from his underwear\u2014no matter how many happy and wholesome thoughts she thinks."}
{"text": "If it wasn\u2019t the building that was (possibly) on fire\u2014she would be the one to combust instead."}
{"text": "So to distract herself some more, she bites her lips and twiddles her fingers and hugs herself a little tighter and rocks back and forth\u2014for the sake of having something else to focus on."}
{"text": "\u201cHey,\u201d in her vision, she notices a pair of feet and bright blue slides."}
{"text": "She gulps; she knows this voice, she\u2019s spent countless nights dreaming about it."}
{"text": "\u201cHi,\u201d she looks up."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa, right?\u201d\n\nHer mouth is dry but she still swallows and ignores the plethora of jealous side eyes and glares sent her way at about the same time, \u201cYup.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you remember me, but,\u201d he slips a (fatal) laugh in between his words."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Jack, your neighbor next door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she feels a bead of sweat trickle down the side of her face."}
{"text": "And really, she can\u2019t always be the awkward next-door neighbor with a schoolgirl crush forever."}
{"text": "She wills herself to be better\u2014more mature and professional, \u201cWe\u2019ve met before.\u201d \n\nShe clarifies and smiles a half smile."}
{"text": "\u201cYeah, I remember,\u201d he returns her smile, but instead of awkward and cute, it\u2019s a devilishly charming and seductive smirk."}
{"text": "\u201cI had just moved in that day and you were\u2014\u201c\n\nShe decides to cut him off there, \u201cStruggling with my key card\u2014yeah\u2014not one of my proudest first encounters.\u201d\n\nHe laughs and suggests a thought she finds absolutely crazy, \u201cWell, we can try again.\u201d \n\nShe blinks and feels the blood rush to her face."}
{"text": "Is he flirting with her?"}
{"text": "She laughs awkwardly instead, \u201cWe already are.\u201d She extends a hand out to him, \u201cI\u2019m Elsa Arendelle, your next-door neighbor.\u201d\n\nHe looks down at her open hand and chuckles the same damn chuckle that always seems like it was out to get her."}
{"text": "\u201cHi, Elsa."}
{"text": "I\u2019m Jack."}
{"text": "Jackson Overland Frost, your next-door neighbor.\u201d\n\nHer eyes soften and she feels a little tinge of relief wash over her."}
{"text": "She knows she has to be half-honest and meet his sincerity with her own, \u201cActually, I know that too.\u201d \n\nHe stares at her."}
{"text": "\u201cWell\u2014everyone\u2014at least every woman\u2014knows who you are,\u201d she laughs an even more awkward laugh than before, internally cringing at her attempts to save herself from being deemed creepy."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd my sister\u2014Anna\u2014told me who you were.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d he nods and understands."}
{"text": "\u201cWell\u2014if we\u2019re being honest, Snowflake\u2014\u201c\n\nSnowflake?"}
{"text": "\u201cI know who you are too,\u201d he smiles and she finds it hard not to be blinded by his bright white teeth."}
{"text": "She understands now\u2014she thinks\u2014why that one girl who he would bring home some nights, the one with the rainbow hair, would always comment on his teeth."}
{"text": "\u201cI know your last name\u2019s Arendelle and that you\u2019re a lawyer,\u201d he finishes and brings her back to the present."}
{"text": "\u201cYou\u2014you know?\u201d\n\nHe nods, \u201cI asked around.\u201d\n\nShe gulps."}
{"text": "Ah."}
{"text": "So he\u2019s asked her around about her before."}
{"text": "Does this mean he\u2019s interested?"}
{"text": "He might be\u2014but at the same time, all those girls he fucked\u2014okay but\u2014she would sometimes bring a few guys home too."}
{"text": "Definitely not as much as he does though."}
{"text": "But they aren\u2019t leaving the \u2018friendly neighbors' zone soon, so she shouldn\u2019t think too much about it."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I see,\u201d she recovers."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s a bit creepy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d \n\nShe should just leave this old schoolgirl crush behind, \n\n\u201cHey hey\u2014\u201c he playfully defends himself."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s only fair, you know a lot about me too.\u201d \n\nBecause if she does, she has a feeling they can be great friends."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s public information,\u201d she rolls her eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cEveryone knows a lot about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014it\u2019s still unfair that my neighbor knows more about me than I know about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you say, Jack Frost.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my defense,\u201d he uses the nickname she was given back in high school."}
{"text": "\u201cSnow Queen,\u201d\n\nHow the hell does he know her high school nickname?"}
{"text": "She wonders but plays it off, \u201cOkay\u2026 all of a sudden you know my past now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201c he stammers for the first time that night\u2014probably for the first time ever in his life\u2014and coughs, \u201cI\u2014I heard about it when I was asking around\u2026 about you.\u201d\n\nShe raises her eyebrow at him and tries to act cool and coy and tries to give off the impression that she\u2019s in the right\u2014or at least she tries to make sure that he can\u2019t tell that she\u2019s about to explode from her heart working overtime."}
{"text": "Priorities, right?"}
{"text": "\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d she states."}
{"text": "\u201cHey\u2014I just wanted to know more about you\u2026\u201d\n\nIs he trying to get into her pants?"}
{"text": "She shoos the thought away and instead laughs a soft laugh, \u201cWell, you can come to the source next time.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s about to say something\u2014she sees those damn lips open\u2014but the sirens are blaring and getting closer so no one talks instead."}
{"text": "A few seconds later, four firemen came running by."}
{"text": "She wonders if Tadashi is one of them."}
{"text": "\u2014\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 it was just some idiot that pulled the alarm?"}
{"text": "!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we at least know who?\u201d\n\nElsa hears the first few tenants, the ones closest to the door and the group of firemen and manager, complain."}
{"text": "She feels herself get a bit annoyed and grow a bit impatient and she\u2019s about to join the swarm making their way back inside until\u2014\n\n\u201cElsa?\u201d One of the firemen came up to her."}
{"text": "\u201cI knew this was your building!\u201d\n\n\u201cTadashi!\u201d Her face unfolds itself and her eyes beam."}
{"text": "\u201cGosh, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n\nFor the first time that night, she unwraps both hands from her body\u2014forgetting about her improper nightgown\u2014and welcomes her childhood friend in for a hug."}
{"text": "\u201cFunny thing,\u201d she adds during their embrace."}
{"text": "\u201cI was wondering if I was going to see you tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunnier thing,\u201d Tadashi comments when they\u2019re apart again."}
{"text": "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t even supposed to be my shift.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo\u2014\u201c\n\nAhem."}
{"text": "The pair look to their left."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa,\u201d Jack calls to her\u2014tone a little too suggestive but strict and a tad bit deeper."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s time we get back inside.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, you can go ahe\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo?\u201d She parrots his word, justifiably confused."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa?\u201d Tadashi chirps in."}
{"text": "\u201cDo you know this guy?"}
{"text": "Is he\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my next-door neighbor, but\u2014\u201c she looks from hot childhood friend to hot neighbor model."}
{"text": "\u201cBut that\u2019s as far as our relationship goes.\u201d\n\nShe winces as she notices Jack\u2019s expression darken."}
{"text": "\u201cMhm,\u201d he rushes his next few words, \u201cHi Elsa\u2019s friend, I\u2019m Jack\u2014her next-door neighbor\u2014and it\u2019s getting late and we\u2019re out here for no other fucking reason for the amusement of a troll and I was just about to walk her back inside, so if you don\u2019t mind\u2014\u201c\n\nHe puts himself next to her and softly weaves his fingers into hers."}
{"text": "Tadashi looks a little confused at this sudden development but his face has nothing on Elsa\u2019s."}
{"text": "Yup."}
{"text": "The building isn\u2019t the one on fire\u2014it\u2019s her."}
{"text": "She prays and prays and prays that Jack can\u2019t feel the sweat forming on her palms."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m going to take her back\u2014\u201c he coughs."}
{"text": "\u201cTo her place.\u201d\n\nTadashi smiles awkwardly, \u201cOkay thanks, Jack."}
{"text": "I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d\n\nElsa swears she heard Jack mumble something under his breath."}
{"text": "\u201cNo need.\u201d\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nBy the time Jack drags Elsa back in through their lobby doors, she notices the crowd thins; hundreds turned to dozens turned to few\u2014here and there."}
{"text": "They enter the elevator together and Elsa mentally prepares herself for the awkward flight of nineteen stories that were to ensue."}
{"text": "\u201cSo\u2026 that firefighter back then is your friend?\u201d\n\nShe nods and gives him the necessary context, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re childhood friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he doesn\u2019t pry for more\u2014something she appreciates."}
{"text": "Neither of them speaks for the rest of the climb and eventually; they were on the 20th floor."}
{"text": "The elevator dings and the doors slide open and Jack lets Elsa step out first before following close behind her."}
{"text": "They walk the rest of the hall in silence."}
{"text": "Jack eventually does the talking again, \u201cYou know\u2026 I meant it right?\u201d\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d she flips her head at him, face a little tired and confused."}
{"text": "\u201cAbout wanting to learn more about you\u2014to get to know you better.\u201d\n\nHer lips form the shape of a knowing \u2018o\u2019."}
{"text": "Blood swims up to her cheeks, tinting them a slight pink, \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill I see you again?\u201d Jack feels a surge of confidence in his feet."}
{"text": "Elsa fights the sleep away and smiles at him, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nShe sees his smile finds its way across his face, \u201cPromise we won\u2019t just be neighbors anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d Elsa finds herself mirroring his wide smile."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll visit\u2026 tomorrow night?\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s wholesome smile morphs into a smirk, \u201cSure\u2026 but\u2014\u201d\n\nShe quirks her head a little bit to the side, waiting for him to finish his sentence before she decides to unlock and open her door."}
{"text": "\u201cBe sure to visit wearing\u2026\u201d his eyes travel the whole length of her."}
{"text": "\u201cThis.\u201d\n\nThe woman yelps and doesn\u2019t let him finish his goodbye and slams the door on his stupid model face."}
{"text": "Behind the door, her ears catch his chuckle and something more:\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Snowflake.\u201d\n\n\u2014-\n\nHams.Tadashi\nAnna, where were you tonight\u2026\n\nAnnaBanana\nUhm\u2026 why?"}
{"text": "Hams.Tadashi\nIstg I saw strawberry blonde exit Elsa\u2019s building\u2026\nWhen the fire department came\nAnnaBanana\n*Gasps* You don\u2019t think it\u2019s me, do you?"}
{"text": "I meannnn\nCome on\nThere\u2019s like\u2026 hundreds of strawberry blondes in NYC\nHams.Tadashi\nWell\u2026 that\u2019s funny because I saw a streak of white in their ponytail as well\nAnna?"}
{"text": "Hello?"}
{"text": "It\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?"}
{"text": "It was a beautiful night and he knew it."}
{"text": "Stars sprinkled unevenly everywhere as if a white paintbrush was flicked over the neverending blanket of the dark canvas."}
{"text": "Not so subtle streaks of purple and green kept the lonely color company."}
{"text": "There wasn\u2019t a single cloud in his peripheral."}
{"text": "\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\nHe was almost there."}
{"text": "Squinting, he saw the familiar silhouette of the castle and the rest of Arendelle serving as its backdrop."}
{"text": "Almost simultaneously, the wind, which kept him from gravity\u2019s grasp, hesitated\u2014 more than it already has since his trek from the North Pole."}
{"text": "Normally, Jack would\u2019ve been ecstatic to visit his queen\u2019s abode."}
{"text": "But tonight was different."}
{"text": "After tonight, he would no longer have a reason to."}
{"text": "There would be no more Elsa to tease and spoil."}
{"text": "No more crazy Anna shipping and fangirling over the Winter Spirit and his Snow Queen."}
{"text": "No more stealing glances at the eternally graceful and ever-beautiful girl as she sits at her desk, scratching her pen over some sort of letter or document that would steal her attention from him."}
{"text": "No more late-night talks where both ice deities would only suffer its aftermath when the rest of the world woke from slumber in all directions."}
{"text": "No more incentive to visit after tonight\u2014 unless he wants his heart to shatter into pieces, more than it already has."}
{"text": "If that\u2019s even possible."}
{"text": "He shook the haunting thoughts out of his head as quickly as it came."}
{"text": "You shouldn\u2019t be out and about wasting your time."}
{"text": "He scolded himself."}
{"text": "You may have the rest of forever to waste but she doesn\u2019t."}
{"text": "And in what felt like an eternity, even for the fun and mischievous, winter spirit, Jack Frost, he was at the edge of Arendelle castle."}
{"text": "At last."}
{"text": "\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\nBeing in the presence of the towering doors was foreign to him."}
{"text": "If given the option between the intimidating doors and Elsa\u2019s window, he would always opt with the latter."}
{"text": "But tonight was different."}
{"text": "He had a feeling that Anna was at her sister\u2019s bedside."}
{"text": "Intruding on their last moments together would be the last thing he wanted\u2014 apart from Elsa leaving him forever of course."}
{"text": "As considerate as he was, his pondering was cut short when he came across the first person he\u2019d see all night."}
{"text": "The guard, a few feet away from him, silently acknowledged his presence and led him through one of the doors, into the halls."}
{"text": "Apart from a few servants who passed by the unusual duo, the castle was empty and quiet."}
{"text": "Acknowledgments and greetings were mutually made through eye contact and subtle nods."}
{"text": "No one saw fit to speak or make any more sound than was necessary, afraid that the noise would disturb the shared solemnity and stab the blanket of grief."}
{"text": "As the distance between Elsa\u2019s room and him shortened, the lower the temperature got."}
{"text": "Although he tried to be discreet, the guard subtly shivered at the sudden change."}
{"text": "But Jack was indifferent to it."}
{"text": "Like his counterpart, the cold never bothered him anyway."}
{"text": "Yards turned into feet and feet turned into inches."}
{"text": "Finally, like all journeys, his dreaded one came to a halt."}
{"text": "Jack was finally here."}
{"text": "He was mere centimeters away from her door."}
{"text": "Afraid to be in the presence of the spirit\u2019s sorrow, the guard motioned his farewells and scurried back to his original post."}
{"text": "As for Jack, like the wind that carried him thousands of miles here, he hesitated."}
{"text": "Who was he to knock and cut short the remaining time the royal sisters had together?"}
{"text": "Plus, his dying lover was on the other side of this door."}
{"text": "And the thought killed him."}
{"text": "\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\nLuckily, he didn\u2019t have to knock."}
{"text": "The door was opened and a waft of even colder air wrapped around his pale face."}
{"text": "From the newfound darkness of the room, he could see strawberry blonde emerge from it."}
{"text": "Anna was crying."}
{"text": "Crying was an understatement."}
{"text": "Jack looked at Anna\u2019s tear-stained face."}
{"text": "He didn\u2019t know that the always cheerful, goofy, fun, and loving Anna was capable of making such a face."}
{"text": "Worse, he didn\u2019t know if Anna would ever return to her once bubbly self."}
{"text": "She had already spent a decade or so without her sister."}
{"text": "And spending the rest of her life without Elsa was way too cruel."}
{"text": "Kristoff, who looked just as bad as his wife followed behind her, his giant hand on her shaking shoulders."}
{"text": "The husband-wife pair walked past Jack, both parties silently addressing each other."}
{"text": "Anna quickly walked away from the hall, not wanting to be near Elsa when she takes her final breath."}
{"text": "And Jack couldn\u2019t blame her."}
{"text": "How can anyone go on living if they witnessed the passing of someone so dear to them."}
{"text": "Shortly behind her, Kristoff gave Jack a most pitiful look before following Anna down the hall, hoping to not only console her but himself as well."}
{"text": "Now all there was before Jack was himself."}
{"text": "And an open door."}
{"text": "\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\nElsa was already long gone."}
{"text": "But how she would give up her life time and time again if she never had to see Anna\u2019s face stricken with tears."}
{"text": "Even as her dear sister\u2019s retreating back is turned from her, the mixture of hicks, screams, whimpers, and sobs etch the back of her mind."}
{"text": "She wasn\u2019t scared of death, never was, never is."}
{"text": "But the unwelcoming sensation of fear crept into her mind as she imagined how the life of her loved ones would be without her beside them."}
{"text": "Her beloved kingdom would recover from their queen\u2019s passing under Anna and Kristoff\u2019s rule."}
{"text": "That she knew, but what about the rulers themselves?"}
{"text": "Will Anna ever be the same?"}
{"text": "What about Kristoff?"}
{"text": "Sven?"}
{"text": "Olaf?"}
{"text": "Jack?"}
{"text": "Jack."}
{"text": "Her thoughts naturally drift to Jack."}
{"text": "She knew he was immortal."}
{"text": "She knew this day would come eventually."}
{"text": "But the said ill-fated day came too soon."}
{"text": "For the first time tonight, she didn\u2019t want eternal slumber to take her from her family."}
{"text": "No, not yet."}
{"text": "Her melancholy thoughts fizzled out as she heard a light sigh at her door."}
{"text": "A sigh so soft that any other type of noise would drown it out."}
{"text": "Except, there was no other noise in the vicinity, besides two beating hearts and their ever so subtle breathing."}
{"text": "Her head snapped to the source so fast, it seemed like she practiced doing so all her life\u2014 waiting for the right moment to do so."}
{"text": "\u201cJack?\u201d\n\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\n\t\u201cJack?\u201d Elsa stared at him quizzically."}
{"text": "His head snapped up to the source of her melodious voice."}
{"text": "No matter how many hours he spent listening intently to her, to every story she shared, to every one of her rants, her airy\u2014 yet soft spoken voice was a song he never could get tired of."}
{"text": "Not now, not for the rest of eternity."}
{"text": "He flashed her a light, dejected smile as he approached her bed and sat down beside her."}
{"text": "Her room was cold, even for Jack himself, someone who was so used to the unpleasant temperature."}
{"text": "Even with the only source of light coming from Elsa\u2019s window and underneath the now-closed door, Jack could still clearly see Elsa\u2019s face as if it was day."}
{"text": "How could he not?"}
{"text": "It was the face that spent so much time cupped in his cold, lanky hands."}
{"text": "\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d He asked her as he usually does when she comes down with a cold\u2014 which is super rare in itself."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m fine."}
{"text": "I think it\u2019s getting better actually,\u201d she responded sarcastically returning his smile with her usual crooked one."}
{"text": "\u2744\u2744\u2744\nJack held her stare for a few seconds before he decided to speak again."}
{"text": "\u201cI wish it would get better,\u201d he pouted."}
{"text": "Despite her worsening condition and hitched breathing, she couldn\u2019t help but find Jack adorable, even when he looked as down as he was."}
{"text": "\u201cMe too,\u201d she responded, matching his gaze."}
{"text": "A provoking silence, aside from the Queen\u2019s heavy breathing, followed."}
{"text": "Elsa could feel her time slipping."}
{"text": "She had so many things she wanted to tell her immortal lover, she didn\u2019t want to waste it, sitting in the deafening silence."}
{"text": "As Jack silently breaks down in front of her, the subject of his torment opened her mouth but no sound came out of those delicate, quivering lips."}
{"text": "Her vocal cords struggled to function properly so she resorted to conveying her many many thoughts in hushed whispers, hoping Jack would catch every word as they fell from her breath\u2014 like how snowflakes descend from the sky."}
{"text": "\u2744\u2744\n\u201cRemember when we first met?\u201d she whispered so faintly that if Jack wasn\u2019t sitting just a few inches from her, he wouldn\u2019t have caught it."}
{"text": "\u201cHow could I not?\u201d he replied, reciprocating her feathery whisper as he recalled their first encounter that one winter night in Arendelle just 20 years ago."}
{"text": "\u201cI thought you were the prettiest girl in the entire world,\u201d he continued."}
{"text": "\u201cReally?\u201d Elsa looked at him skeptically."}
{"text": "\u201cIn your 300 or so years of being immortal and on top of your human years?"}
{"text": "I doubt that.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true though.\u201d \nAnd oh boy was it true, then and now."}
{"text": "Even when the unwelcomed symptoms of aging wedged its way onto her once flawless skin, she was still the most beautiful girl he\u2019d ever had the pleasure of looking at."}
{"text": "Elsa stared at him, visibly expressing her displeasure at how corny he was\u2014 something unnatural for his usual mischievous self."}
{"text": "He stared back."}
{"text": "Breaking her gaze was unheard of."}
{"text": "Hand in hand in the recurring ear-piercing silence, with Jack sitting at his lover\u2019s bedside and said lover sitting upright on her bed, the two looked at each other."}
{"text": "No longer did Elsa feel the need to spill all her unspoken thoughts onto Jack."}
{"text": "Even without spending the rest of eternity together, the similar\u2014 yet so different winter mortal and immortal pair knew what the other was thinking."}
{"text": "."}
{"text": "."}
{"text": "."}
{"text": "Their unspoken conversation went on for what felt like forever, and for once in his \u2018life\u2019, Jack was fine with the idea of it."}
{"text": "But even forever must come to an end."}
{"text": "5."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know I love you,\u201d mouthed Elsa."}
{"text": "\u201cI know."}
{"text": "I love you too.\u201d\n\t4."}
{"text": "\u201cFind love again, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he hummed."}
{"text": "How could he?"}
{"text": "3."}
{"text": "\u201cBut don\u2019t forget me.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\nOnce again, how could he?"}
{"text": "2."}
{"text": "\u201cI love nights like these.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do.\u201d\n1."}
{"text": "\u201dYou\u2019ll always have me.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nAnd along with her last breath, two beating hearts become one."}
{"text": "The silence was pierced with sobs from the last person anyone expected them from\u2014 Jack."}
{"text": "\u2744\n\tSome time passed before he decided it was time to go."}
{"text": "As if on cue for the curtain call, the first hint of sunrise unveiled itself, it\u2019s introduction disturbing the, once, perfect night sky\u2019s solo."}
{"text": "Anna came back to the room she was forbidden from for most of her childhood, to an open window, just missing Jack\u2019s departure."}
{"text": "~\nIt\u2019s been a decade or so since the Man in the Moon came for her, but Jack would always aimlessly find his way back to Arendelle."}
{"text": "As the rest of the world continues to move and as time continues to run, her absence in this life would be minuscule."}
{"text": "Despite that, he saw the whole world in her, but what good is it without the rest of eternity?"}
{"text": "He stared aimlessly at the moon, the subject to his constant pleas and cries to bring her back to him, claiming it was the least it could do as it was also responsible for his immortality and powers\u2014 something he never requested to begin with."}
{"text": "Too bad, Jack thought."}
{"text": "It was a night she would have adored."}
{"text": "\tUgh."}
{"text": "Elsa grunted as one of the first few drops of liquid ascends from the sky, staining her cheek."}
{"text": "What was thought of as an innocent droplet soon multiplied into a shower of glittering beads that descended almost simultaneously one after another\u2014 much to Elsa\u2019s dismay."}
{"text": "The city was shortly wrapped in a blanket of gray clouds, little remnants of the sun fighting to shine through."}
{"text": "But as quickly as it came, the rainclouds worked fast to curtain the deity, its rays no longer visible as the world beneath it retreated to shelter."}
{"text": "It was an unwelcomed sight to behold."}
{"text": "Thanks to the weather\u2019s 180-degree turn, the almost sudden temperature drop came hand in hand with it, but it was something she didn\u2019t mind."}
{"text": "Yet, because Elsa left home unprepared, she found herself among one of the many naive people who fell victim to another one of heaven\u2019s mood swings."}
{"text": "Elsa\u2019s pace quickened as she internally decided between rushing home or taking a detour to one of the many caf\u00e9s on the busy street."}
{"text": "It wasn\u2019t long before her monologue decided on the latter."}
{"text": "A mocha latte would do the trick."}
{"text": "She grinned to herself, ecstatic at the idea of spending the noon reading, her idea of unwinding, at an unsuspecting caf\u00e9."}
{"text": "Dumped at the core of the astir Manhattan, Elsa encountered no shortage of coffee shops, but because of the rain\u2019s sudden intrusion, her idea to avoid it was proven unauthentic."}
{"text": "Apparently, three Starbucks placed strategically on the same street isn\u2019t enough to satisfy the commuters on their tramp home from work."}
{"text": "She sighed to herself, huffing out a cloud that dissipated into the atmosphere almost as quickly as it came, leaving little time for awe."}
{"text": "Losing not much but just a little bit of hope\u2014 and patience, Elsa rounded the corner onto a different street."}
{"text": "Scanning the area, she noticed two more caf\u00e9s, maybe four if bubble tea shops count."}
{"text": "But upon looking through the translucent windows, her shoulders drooped."}
{"text": "They too seem to be packed with people who too had hoped to avoid the growing downpour outside."}
{"text": "Elsa\u2019s mood dampened with her clothes and hair, but she nevertheless surveyed the street one more time, convinced that this umpteenth time would be her final."}
{"text": "It must\u2019ve been the water that got in her eye causing her to squint, but she swore that single droplet was a godsend."}
{"text": "Thanks to the sneaky little rascal, she noticed a small, narrow coffee shop wedged between another Starbucks and a Half & Half."}
{"text": "Unlike its two neighbors, it didn\u2019t have a \u2018see-through window\u2019 to flaunt its interior and lure in giddy customers."}
{"text": "The average person wouldn\u2019t even have suspected the narrow store to be a coffee shop\u2014 much less notice it."}
{"text": "And to the select few who thought to look just slightly above them, they would\u2019ve been greeted with a wooden sign hanging out to the street, perpendicular to the store."}
{"text": "Then, they would have an option between the no-named bistro or the two major franchises that sandwich it."}
{"text": "A normal person would go with the latter options\u2014 after all, they\u2019re major franchises for a reason."}
{"text": "Elsa was under the \u2018average person\u2019 category because, if it wasn\u2019t for the droplet, she would\u2019ve for sure missed it."}
{"text": "But she was in no way a \u2018normal person\u2019."}
{"text": "Major franchises be damned if it means she finally has a haven from the rain and a place to enjoy her book in, which was waiting for her safely in the covert of her bag."}
{"text": "Ring."}
{"text": "The golden bell, perched at the top of the caf\u00e9 entrance, chimed, signaling Elsa\u2019s arrival."}
{"text": "Jack\u2019s POV\n\tAnd\u2026 done!"}
{"text": "Jackson stepped exactly four feet away from the wall to admire his handiwork."}
{"text": "An additional step and his back would\u2019ve been tickled with the numerous antennas reaching out of the clay pot, meant to keep the rowdy vines in check."}
{"text": "But a step shorter and his peripheral would just miss the tip of the paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9\u2019d top hat, the crown of his work."}
{"text": "His thin lips curved into a dainty smile as he basked in the presence of his latest exploit meant to pass time."}
{"text": "A 3D armadillo, made up of an array of yellow and brown, quite literally popped out of his otherwise dull drawing of the night sky, its wide torso covering up more than half the painting."}
{"text": "As if that wasn\u2019t arbitrary enough, two giant sculpted palms, complementary with fingers, accompanied the animal to complete the \u2018look\u2019 Jack had in mind."}
{"text": "But what the artist was most proud of was not the round-spectacles nested on the armadillo\u2019s nose or the blue and yellow origami butterflies he somehow managed to stick on."}
{"text": "Despite being responsible for knotting the whole ordeal together, the pair\u2019s efforts went unnoticed."}
{"text": "Nope."}
{"text": "It wasn\u2019t them."}
{"text": "Instead, the reason for Jack\u2019s giddiness came from the top hat, nested between the armadillo\u2019s cardboard ears."}
{"text": "The hat was ornamented with vibrant-hued knick-knacks that would have alternatively laid around his store, attracting dust."}
{"text": "Hues that would otherwise have no place in his work\u2014 if Jack gave a damn about presentability."}
{"text": "Bordered with an intricately patterned gold frame, salvaged from god knows where, his apparition was fulfilled."}
{"text": "He couldn\u2019t help but feel inflated at his\u2026 painting?"}
{"text": "Sculpture?"}
{"text": "Painting sculpture?"}
{"text": "Work of art."}
{"text": "He had used up hours\u2014 that would\u2019ve ended up wasted regardless, on said \u2018work of art.\u2019 \n\nThe proposal to name it, so it doesn\u2019t have to be referred to as just \u2018work of art\u2019, came to him, only to end up being shooed away."}
{"text": "Jack was in no way a ponderer."}
{"text": "The idea of over analyzing, even the smallest of things, and the need to have a reason for this and a reason for that turned him off."}
{"text": "Hypothetically, if he were to be asked to explain what his work meant, much less name it, he would be incapable of supplying a satisfactory answer."}
{"text": "\u201cSandy."}
{"text": "Pitch.\u201d Jack called to the abnormal chess-playing duo on the other side of his store."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat do you think of this work of art?\u201d \nUpon the voice\u2019s summon, Pitch and Sandy looked up from their intimate game, their attention now on Jack and his \u2018work of art\u2019."}
{"text": "Sandy, a bright, short, and chubby man with rowley blonde hair, gave him a hesitative nod, supported with two thumbs up."}
{"text": "Pitch, the complete opposite of his dedicated chess opponent, a tall, dull man, sporting spiky black hair, with ghostly\u2014 but still human-like skin, looked at Jack quizzically."}
{"text": "\u201cThat is what you consider a \u2018work of art\u2019?\u201d\nOn cue with his emphasis, he raised his long, lanky fingers, turning them into a pair of quotation marks to further mock Jack\u2019s name for it."}
{"text": "Jack chuckled in amusement."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, if you really think about it, anything can be considered a work of art, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cSome more than others.\u201d Pitch grumbled as he turned his conscience back to the board and its pieces, where Sandy patiently awaited his next move."}
{"text": "Jack turned away from his most loyal customers and smiled, leaving them unperturbed once again."}
{"text": "With his creative hunger pleased, he decided to do his job."}
{"text": "Humming in content, he took out trimmers from his apron pocket and turned to the vines awaiting him."}
{"text": "They\u2019ve been neglected for long enough."}
{"text": "Ring."}
{"text": "Jack was indifferent to the chime."}
{"text": "99% of the time, visitors who play the bell have been here before, accustomed to their way around."}
{"text": "\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cBack here!\u201d Jackson yelled over the variety of plants and flowers that flocked the entrance."}
{"text": "It seems like this instance was the 1%."}
{"text": "<>\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, am I...\u201d the voice grew louder, giving Jack the assumption she rounded the corner, closing in on him."}
{"text": "\u201c...in the right place?\u201d she finished her question, now right in front of the boy."}
{"text": "Jack\u2019s eyes dilated, showing off his cornflower blue irises."}
{"text": "Snip."}
{"text": "He accidentally cut off an extra inch or two from the ill-fated vine."}
{"text": "He didn\u2019t care."}
{"text": "Plants can grow back."}
{"text": "On the other hand, he\u2019d never seen a girl as, for lack of words, beautiful as the one standing before him."}
{"text": "People who say beauty is on the inside are dirty, filthy liars\u2014 that, or they just haven\u2019t, unfortunately, been blessed with this girl in their presence yet."}
{"text": "Closing his slightly agape mouth, Jack picked up his composure before she suspects he\u2019s a weird man."}
{"text": "\u201cDescribe \u2018right place\u2019\u201d, he responded, imitating Pitch\u2019s \u2018quotation mark fingers\u2019 from before."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, I was hoping this might be a coffee shop.\u201d\n\tElsa looked around, slightly intrigued\u2014 but disgusted at all the random pots of plants and vines hanging from the ceiling and the assortment of paintings and pictures on the wall."}
{"text": "It seemed to her that they were just hung up with no mind as to how they might fit and look next to each other, that they were just busybodies meant to occupy the space."}
{"text": "More pots, housing all kinds of colorful and diverse species of plants, were sitting with random trinkets\u2014 some she\u2019d never even seen before, on the floor, counters, and, occasionally, tables, making the place seem smaller than it already was."}
{"text": "\u201cBut it looks more like a\u2026 flower shop?\u201d she guessed."}
{"text": "Jack let out a light laugh at her uncertainty."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, both your guesses are right."}
{"text": "This place is a flower shop and a bistro.\u201d Jack assured her."}
{"text": "She looked unconvinced at the latter."}
{"text": "Having no verbal way to convince her, he beckoned, \u201cHere, follow me."}
{"text": "The counter\u2019s at the back.\u201d \n\tDesperate for shelter from the growing torrential downpour outside, she followed."}
{"text": "\u201cWelcome to Wonder-land, what can I treat the missus to today?\u201d Jack flashed his signature, charming smile at the girl over the coffee counter, the only normal thing in this store."}
{"text": "Neglecting his efforts to woo her, her eyes glued itself to the hand-written menu hanging behind him."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll have a small iced mocha latt\u00e9,\u201d she requested."}
{"text": "Jack snorted at her request."}
{"text": "\u201cReally?"}
{"text": "I thought you would be a tea kind of person.\u201d \n\tElsa looked unfazed, deliberately ignoring his slightly rude assumption."}
{"text": "Catching onto her displeasure, Jack scrambled to ease it."}
{"text": "\u201cFor here or to go?\u201d\n\t\u201cFor here,\u201d she answered as she took out her wallet and handed him a five."}
{"text": "\u201cKeep the change.\u201d\n\tJack couldn\u2019t help but smile at her answer."}
{"text": "\u201cAlright, you can have a seat at any of the open tables in this store and I\u2019ll bring your drink over\u2014 when it\u2019s done of course.\u201d\n\tShe turned to leave."}
{"text": "\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Jack called out to her."}
{"text": "\u201cHere.\u201d\n\tHe handed her a single daisy."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s for first-time customers,\u201d he told her, reassuring her skepticism."}
{"text": "Not seeing the need to verbally respond, she dipped her head lightly to thank him and turned to an empty table near the window, she had noticed on her way in."}
{"text": "In a good mood, she gracefully tucked the flower between one of the knots in her loose french braid, resting lazily on her shoulder."}
{"text": "The usually regal girl couldn\u2019t contain her growing smile as she sat down, having finally found a place to enjoy her book in."}
{"text": "The seat was rather comfy so she had no problem adjusting to it."}
{"text": "Five seconds in, she was already engulfed in her book."}
{"text": "The condition of this store and the slightly annoying barista no longer accompanied a place in her mind."}
{"text": "\u201cHere, an iced mocha latt\u00e9 for the pretty missus.\u201d Jack bent over."}
{"text": "He proceeded to delicately place her cup on the low, circular table."}
{"text": "\u201cWhew, it\u2019s not everyday you see someone reading a dictionary.\u201d He whistled."}
{"text": "Crack."}
{"text": "Elsa\u2019s perfect fantasy shattered, along with the little amount of patience she had."}
{"text": "After a long day of classes, an unannounced downpour, a struggle to find a place to shelter in, resulting in her discomfited state because of her damp hair and clothes, Elsa felt like shit."}
{"text": "And all it took was an overly cocky and annoying barista to push her off the edge of the already cracking ice."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not everyday you encounter a flower-coffee, whatever shop, only to meet an overly-nosy, rude, infuriating, and overall annoying barista who can\u2019t keep his pretty little head to himself.\u201d she shot back, discarding whatever amount of regality she had left."}
{"text": "Taken aback by her sudden outburst, Jack instinctively stepped back, using the tray that assisted him, to shield himself."}
{"text": "Even Pitch and Sandy, who were sitting across the room from her, turned."}
{"text": "Elsa gasped as her brain worked to keep up and process what she had just said to the poor, unknowing barista."}
{"text": "Her icy orbs widened in alarm."}
{"text": "\u201cI-I\u2019m so very sorry for what I just said."}
{"text": "I-I know making excuses is insincere, b-but today was an off-day for me and I\u2014\u201d she fumbled her words, trying to apologize and explain herself to the recipient of her indecency."}
{"text": "Jack blinked at the flabbergasted girl in front of him."}
{"text": "She was no longer the noble girl he had just met, tripping on all the words she managed to get out of her quivering lips."}
{"text": "Jack laughed a loud, crude laugh, tears forming on the edges of his eyes."}
{"text": "Pitch rolled his eyes at Jack and Sandy smiled, once again, resuming their silent game of chess."}
{"text": "Recovering from his fit of laughter, he smiled."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d he wiped his tears."}
{"text": "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d she started."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s really alright.\u201d he interrupted her."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m really sorry."}
{"text": "Is there any way I can make it up to you?\u201d she retaliated, guilt still very much present in her pleading eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cHmm\u2026 if you insist\u2026\u201d Jack started, right hand on his chin, fake-contemplating."}
{"text": "\u201cChat with me."}
{"text": "At least for five minutes.\u201d\n\tElsa hesitated."}
{"text": "\u201cBut don\u2019t you have work to do?\u201d she asked him, trying to rid herself of the predicament she got herself into."}
{"text": "Jack chuckled at her, catching on to her ulterior motive."}
{"text": "\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\t\u201cUh\u2026\u201d, she looked around."}
{"text": "\u201cCleaning?\u201d\n\tJack wiped his fingertip on one one of the nearby counters topped with a few pots of plants."}
{"text": "\u201cSpotless.\u201d He showed her his dust-less finger."}
{"text": "\u201cWhat about the vines."}
{"text": "Weren\u2019t you in the middle of trimming them before I interrupted you?\u201d she pursued."}
{"text": "\u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d He hummed lazily."}
{"text": "Finding herself with no other choice but to accept his proposal to a five minute conversation, she surrendered."}
{"text": "\u201cAlright, five minutes.\u201d She sighed defeatedly."}
{"text": "Jack grinned as he took the seat across from her, internally celebrating his triumph over her stubbornness."}
{"text": "Afraid to waste the time he was generously given, he bombarded the poor girl with questions right away."}
{"text": "\u201cMay I have your name?\u201d\nShe looked up from her book and looked at him."}
{"text": "\u201cUsually, I don\u2019t give my name to people whom I just met 10 minutes ago.\u201d she got back to her book."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, without a name I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to resort to calling you missus for the next five minutes,\u201d Jack sighed dejectedly slumping down into his chair."}
{"text": "Elsa\u2019s attention shot back to him."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa."}
{"text": "It\u2019s Elsa.\u201d\nJack\u2019s facade faded, cheering up over something as simple as a name."}
{"text": "\u201cElsa."}
{"text": "A name fit for the pretty missus,\u201d he awed at her name."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Jackson by the way, but you can call me Jack.\u201d\nShe nodded, acknowledging what he said, too bothered to respond."}
{"text": "\u201cSo\u2026 Elsa.\u201d Jack sought to continue their conversation."}
{"text": "\u201cWhy a dictionary?"}
{"text": "And why are you so into reading a dictionary,\u201d he put emphasis on \u2018dictionary\u2019 twice."}
{"text": "Without putting the book down, she responded lightly, \u201cbecause Jack, a dictionary is educational.\u201d\nJack guffawed."}
{"text": "He couldn\u2019t process why people would voluntarily read, much less read to learn."}
{"text": "Elsa sighed and elaborated, \u201cdon\u2019t you find yourself lacking the right word to use sometimes?\u201d\nJack shrugged, \u201cNot really, not everything needs words to explain it with.\u201d\n\u201cPlus, even if I did lack the right words, reading a dictionary is not worth it,\u201d he had emphasized the word \u2018dictionary\u2019 three times now."}
{"text": "She glared at him, unamused."}
{"text": "At this point, she figured mockery is a habit of his and there\u2019s no use in losing her demeanor over it\u2014 again."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s also to keep nosy, white-haired baristas away,\u201d she added smugly."}
{"text": "\u201cOr, it can be a great conversation starter,\u201d Jack added on to her claim with his own."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd mine\u2019s actually proven too.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes, \u201cI\u2019ve only read a dictionary in public once, it\u2019s best not to draw conclusions yet.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, I think I look good in white hair."}
{"text": "It really makes my eyes pop.\u201d Jack added as he remembered her comment about his hair color."}
{"text": "\u201cPlus, your hair is not much darker than mine.\u201d\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s natural,\u201d she muttered, head returning to her book."}
{"text": "Jack laughed, eyeing her dictionary."}
{"text": "\u201cI mean, words are cool and all but I like to express my thoughts through art,\u201d he revived their dictionary topic, realizing his last comment unknowingly pulled her string\u2014 again."}
{"text": "He smirked, \u201cIn fact, this whole shop is filled with my art.\u201d\nAfraid to lose Elsa\u2019s attention to the dictionary, settled in her hand, once more, Jack pointed out his latest \u2018work of art.\u2019 \n\u201cSee that?\u201d he smiled proudly."}
{"text": "\u201cThat\u2019s the newest piece to my collection.\u201d\nElsa turned to the direction his finger was pointing."}
{"text": "\u201cEh\u2026 that looks\u2026 nice\u2026?\u201d she stared at it, wondering what\u2014 and why it was."}
{"text": "Jack couldn\u2019t help but snicker at her speechlessness, surprised that her vocabulary still included basic words like \u2018nice\u2019 and words that aren\u2019t even real words like \u2018eh\u2019."}
{"text": "She turned back to him, a sudden trace of curiosity crept its way on her face."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering, why is this place so discreet?"}
{"text": "I didn\u2019t even notice there was a window that faces the street.\u201d Elsa questioned, motioning her head to the window on her right."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, the window is tinted from the outside."}
{"text": "But from the inside, we can see everything out there clearly,\u201d Jack answered, motioning his head to the other side of the window."}
{"text": "\u201cBut why?"}
{"text": "Shouldn\u2019t it be clear from the outside to, you know, attract customers?"}
{"text": "Even in the rain, this place is\u2026 empty.\u201d She looked around, confirming the latter."}
{"text": "\u201cWell, first off, we\u2019re financially stable thanks to our loyal customers,\u201d Jack replied, beckoning to Sandy and Pitch."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd even though we don\u2019t make nearly as much as our neighbors, I\u2019d have it no other way.\u201d\nJack leaned back in his chair, one leg crossed over the other, and hands over his head, forming a makeshift pillow."}
{"text": "His lidded eyes completed the look."}
{"text": "\u201cBesides, thanks to my artistic abilities, it\u2019s like our own little world in here, away from one of the busiest cities in the world,\u201d he continued, opening one of his eyes to look at Elsa."}
{"text": "Elsa looked around, cautiously taking in the sight of the small store surrounding her once more."}
{"text": "He was right."}
{"text": "Although it might look irregular at the first inspection, she realized that every odd trinket and their complementary place in the shop was intentional."}
{"text": "She couldn't help but draw similarities between the \u2018flower-coffee shop\u2019 and the taverns and greenhouses she envisioned so many times before, when submerged in a good fantasy book, full of wizards, knights, princes, and queens."}
{"text": "The place felt magical\u2014 even without the magic, much like a\u2026 Wonderland."}
{"text": "She smiled to herself."}
{"text": "It really was a different world from the one just over the window."}
{"text": "\u201cYou really thought it all out, didn\u2019t you\u2014?"}
{"text": "The interior and design of this place I mean,\u201d she asked Jack, admiration clearly painted on her face."}
{"text": "Jack blinked."}
{"text": "\u201cUh, no not really,\u201d he confessed."}
{"text": "\u201cI just went with my gut.\u201d\n\u201cBut if I had to lie to sway you, then yes, all of this took hours of thinking to come up with,\u201d he smirked, fist lightly tapping his head."}
{"text": "She rolled her eyes."}
{"text": "\u201cHow did you even get the owner to let you put up all the\u2026\u201d she contemplated on the right word to finish her question with."}
{"text": "\u201cWorks of art?\u201d\nJack laughed at her."}
{"text": "\u201cI don\u2019t need approval."}
{"text": "I\u2019m the owner.\u201d\nElsa\u2019s eyes widened in surprise."}
{"text": "\u201cYou?"}
{"text": "But you don\u2019t look older than 18.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m offended,\u201d Jack faked a sob."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m 21, I\u2019m legal.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes\u2014 again at the last part."}
{"text": "\u201cOkay, but aren\u2019t you also a college student?\u2019 she started."}
{"text": "\u201cMost people opt to go to college nowadays,\u201d she added, making sure he knows that her question was out of pure curiosity and had no rude intentions."}
{"text": "\u201cNope, after graduating high school, I chose to open this store with the help of my family and friends.\u201d Jack smiled, recalling the support he\u2019d received from those close to him."}
{"text": "\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?"}
{"text": "How old are you?"}
{"text": "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re still in school?\u201d He directed the subject of conversation to her."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m 22."}
{"text": "And yeah, a business major.\u201d \nJack smiled for the hundredth time that day, soreness creeping on his cheeks."}
{"text": "\u201cWell that explains why you were wondering about the lack of customers and our profits.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so."}
{"text": "It\u2019s in our best interests,\u201d she flushed slightly, embarrassed at her intruding question just a few minutes ago."}
{"text": "A comfortable silence befell the two as Elsa found her way back to the book in her hand, and as Jack turned his focus to the world on the other side of the window."}
{"text": "Priorly lost in each other\u2019s company, they hadn\u2019t noticed the rain outside had begun to pour down harder."}
{"text": "Jack looked outside and grimaced."}
{"text": "\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be awhile till the rain stops.\u201d\nElsa nodded glumly."}
{"text": "\u201cI noticed you ordered an iced latt\u00e9, does the cold weather not bother you?\u201d Jack strived to continue their pleasant conversation from before, refusing to sit in silence with the girl, who, unbeknownst to herself, gained more and more of his affection."}
{"text": "\u201cNope, I like the cold."}
{"text": "Not the rain, but the cold.\u201d\nJack eagerly looked at her, \u201cI agree, the cold is awesome."}
{"text": "And a snow day would make it more awesome.\u201d\n\u201cYes, a snow-day would be nice!\u201d Elsa excitedly replied, thinking back to the snow days she\u2019d experienced and how she had all but positive memories of them."}
{"text": "Jack couldn\u2019t help but soften at her newfound giddiness."}
{"text": "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were the Snow Queen in your past life.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turned out to be the reincarnation of the Winter Spirit, Jack Frost,\u201d she rebutted his joke with her own."}
{"text": "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised either.\u201d Jack chuckled."}
{"text": "\u201cBut I bet he wouldn\u2019t have been able to grow flowers, y\u2019know, with his powers and all.\u201d\nHis mention of flowers re-ignited Elsa\u2019s curiosity, reminding her of an inquiry that slipped her mind."}
{"text": "\u201cSay, why flower shop?"}
{"text": "I mean it could\u2019ve been anything else, so why a flower shop?\u201d\nAt her question, Jack found himself pondering for the first time in a long while."}
{"text": "\u201cSo,\u201d he started, his hand reaching into his pocket to retrieve something, fighting to resist a smile\nHe leaned over the table, towards Elsa."}
{"text": "\u201cI can put another flower in your hair,\u201d he teased, flashing his signature lopsided smirk as his hands work to carefully secure the flower in her platinum-blonde locks."}
{"text": "He retreated back to his seat, \u201cNow, you look even more beautiful with two flowers in your hair!\u201d\nJack\u2019s cheeks were tinted red, but nowhere as near as Elsa\u2019s hue of dangerously bright pink."}
{"text": "\u201cW-Was that your way of f-flirting with me?\u201d she squeaked incredulously, choking on her words."}
{"text": "Cute."}
{"text": "Jack thought."}
{"text": "\u201cYou know, Elsa, you ask quite a lot of questions,\u201d Jack stood up, laughing."}
{"text": "\u201cConsidering you only had five minutes,\u201d he winked."}
{"text": "At that remark, Elsa\u2019s recovery was in vain because her face tinged a brighter shade."}
{"text": "She groaned, bringing her book up to shield her vulnerable face from the conniving barista, but at the same time, trying to hide her disappointment at his departure."}
{"text": "He may or he may not have noticed her crestfallen face, but as if on cue, he reached down to grab her empty cup."}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019ll be back with your refill and my own iced drink,\u201d he said between grins."}
{"text": "To his words, Elsa lightened up."}
{"text": "\u201cAlright,\u201d she responded passively, hiding her elation."}
{"text": "\u201cI look forward to your return.\u201d\n\u201cKeep talking like that and I won\u2019t return,\u201d Jack teased, poking fun at her professional manner of talking."}
{"text": "Hmph."}
{"text": "Elsa huffed and fake-pouted at his mockery."}
{"text": "\u201cBe back in a jiffy,\u201d he reassured her, walking back to the counter."}
{"text": "Elsa sat in quietness, left to savor Pitch\u2019s tapping and Sandy\u2019s tranquil humming."}
{"text": "She turned to the window."}
{"text": "The rain was no more."}
{"text": "And the once almost empty Manhattan streets were livened with a fresh set of scrambling commuters, eager to head home from their evening shift."}
{"text": "But despite the cloud\u2019s parting and the comeback of the sun\u2019s awaited rays, she allowed herself to continue sitting in her sequestered world, anticipating Jack\u2019s return."}
{"text": "Smiling in content, she surrendered her book back to her bag, her hands ridded of the companion for the first time that afternoon."}
{"text": "Nights like these were his favorite: when the air was crisp and sharp\u2014even for someone whose lungs didn\u2019t work\u2014 when the temperature was cool enough for a blue hoodie and bare feet, when the sky was without a single cloud in sight\u2014when the earth was laid bare and naked to the heavens above."}
{"text": "Nights like these remind him of Arendelle."}
{"text": "The Guardian of Fun smiled to himself as he drew the connection between Burgess and Arendelle."}
{"text": "Hell, did everything remind him of Arendelle?"}
{"text": "Yes, yes they did."}
{"text": "Well for a good reason he supposed."}
{"text": "Actually, it\u2019s hard to not compare\u2014which was a bit unfair really as Arendelle would always reign above all."}
{"text": "He smirked as he reminds himself of the reason why."}
{"text": "He should probably get his responsibilities over with if he missed said kingdom this much."}
{"text": "If he missed her this much."}
{"text": "He wanted to see her again."}
{"text": "As the wind took him for a ride around Burgess, assisting him in his duty of bringing snow days to the unsuspecting people below, Jack Frost wondered to himself: Does she miss him the way he misses her?"}
{"text": "He fucking hopes so\u2014and maybe\u2014 just maybe, he would like to claim he knows so."}
{"text": "But as powerful as the Guardians of Childhood are, their magic is oh so limited."}
{"text": "So try as he might, he\u2019ll never really know for sure what Elsa was thinking\u2014and the closest he\u2019ll ever get is when she wears her heart on her sleeves (which was rare in itself, especially as she got older)."}
{"text": "But\u2026 with or without the power to know what she\u2019s thinking, he thinks it was never safer to assume she did\u2014that she had in fact missed him."}
{"text": "He might even dare say she loves him."}
{"text": "Jack\u2019s heart smiled at the thought, somersaulting with joy inside his ribcage like him in the wind\u2019s grasp."}
{"text": "But the logic that resides deep within him thought otherwise."}
{"text": "Please, you\u2019re not even together that way."}
{"text": "Jack\u2019s face soured."}
{"text": "Being optimistic was good and all, but, at least retain some form of reason."}
{"text": "And maybe then, the fall won\u2019t hurt as much if it\u2019s expected\u2026 if your hopes weren\u2019t that high-achieving, to begin with."}
{"text": "Jack Frost bit the inside of his lip grimly."}
{"text": "Was that blood he tasted?"}
{"text": "Who ever knows for sure?"}
{"text": "And he wasn\u2019t willing to find out."}
{"text": "~~~\n\nJack Frost wasn\u2019t much of a thinker (and he was never really a doer either)."}
{"text": "He went where the wind takes him."}
{"text": "Wherever the wind thought fit to bring him next, he obliged without a question."}
{"text": "But tonight, he felt the need to stray from the wind\u2019s will, he wanted to confront someone about something\u2014about the weird, ever-growing feeling in his non-beating heart."}
{"text": "So for the first time in a long while, Jack Frost pondered."}
{"text": "And he had used the whole fly to Arendelle to do it."}
{"text": "He\u2019d known Elsa for well over 12 years now."}
{"text": "Since she was around 5 years old or so."}
{"text": "He knew just how much she\u2019d been through\u2014 after all\u2014 he was right beside her for the whole of it, no?"}
{"text": "Maybe that was why she still believed in him, why she could still see him."}
{"text": "He would be lying to himself\u2014and to the rest of the world\u2014 if he said he didn\u2019t fear the idea of her not ever being to see him again, of how, one day, she would walk right through the ghost of him."}
{"text": "But after many late-night talks and deep, life-questioning conversations, he came to believe\u2014to hope\u2014 that that wouldn\u2019t happen."}
{"text": "That, unlike Jamie, Elsa was different."}
{"text": "She wasn\u2019t a special case."}
{"text": "She wasn\u2019t\u2026 but she went ahead and became one."}
{"text": "And she had years over Jamie to prove it."}
{"text": "At first, it was just a friendship."}
{"text": "A very, real and raw friendship."}
{"text": "Between two people who are so alike yet so different in their many many unique ways\u2014in ways, the rest of the world could only ever hope to understand."}
{"text": "But years later, when Elsa neared his age, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder."}
{"text": "Elsa was beautiful."}
{"text": "She was never not so."}
{"text": "He knew it."}
{"text": "But it just took him a tad bit longer to realize that the new unknowing feeling in his frozen heart was love."}
{"text": "Attraction is a very weird thing indeed but hey, can you really blame him?"}
{"text": "For being eternally 17?"}
{"text": "No, no you cannot."}
{"text": "It wasn\u2019t that way at first, and it wasn\u2019t his fault Elsa was growing."}
{"text": "~~~\n\nJack\u2019s flight was nearing an end as he can see the familiar silhouette of Arendelle castle in the far distance."}
{"text": "Like Burgess, the night was clear, rendering him bare to the stars above, to the moon, to Manny."}
{"text": "He growled to himself as his mind passed over the thought of Manny."}
{"text": "Does he know of Jack\u2019s intentions to confess tonight?"}
{"text": "Jack sure hopes not."}
{"text": "But it wouldn\u2019t be a very Manny thing to not know."}
{"text": "(And why did the word \u2018confess\u2019 feel so weird?"}
{"text": "Or was it the idea of it?"}
{"text": "Maybe confrontation was the better term.)"}
{"text": "As he neared his destination, his heart got all the more closer to his throat, clawing its way out."}
{"text": "Save me from the embarrassment."}
{"text": "It screams."}
{"text": "Jack couldn\u2019t agree more."}
{"text": "Where was this heightened level of confidence coming from?"}
{"text": "Had Sandy done something to mess with his subconscious again?"}
{"text": "But he knew the answer deep down."}
{"text": "Asking useless questions was just a way of coping."}
{"text": "His selfish self wasn\u2019t okay with the idea of what he already is to Elsa, he wanted to be something more, more than what he already is to her: a guardian and a (best) friend."}
{"text": "And unless the quick (un)secretive glances, the not pulling away from physical touch, the closer-than-personal-space-close interactions, and the shared looks of fondness were something just friends did, then his success rate tonight was high\u2014if he does say so himself."}
{"text": "And then he was finally here."}
{"text": "He picked up his heart as he sighed for the last time that night before stepping into her window, open as it waits for him."}
{"text": "His mind runs over the rehearsal of his intended words once more."}
{"text": "Maybe if he willed it hard enough, his feelings would be reciprocated."}
{"text": "."}
{"text": "."}
{"text": "."}
{"text": "\u201cI love you."}
{"text": "So please say you love me too.\u201d"}
